5703215,"Owned for 1 month, used strictly in indoor office for streaming music.

Pros: impressive battery life, lasts all day, way longer than I was expecting. Durable, doesn't feel cheap.

Cons: wish there was a nub on the buttons (like brail, or the nub on your F and J keys on a physical keyboard) so I can tell which button I am pressing when I have the headset on my ears.

Other thoughts: okay sound and okay comfort. Can't complain for the price range.",5.0

I planned to attach to the front of my backpack for easy camera access while climbing Mt Kilimanjaro.  The case is well constructed and exceeded my quality expectations.  It has multiple attachment configurations for vertical or horizontal straps, including a carrying handle.  UNFORTUNATELY, Amazon did not list the INTERNAL compartment size in the description and my camera did not fit with my wide angle lens attached.  The camera was a snug fit with no attachments and the included filter case removed.  I recommend this case as long as your device is within the 3"" diameter x 4.5"" length internal compartment specs.

Cools very well. Has an on/off switch in the back and two USB ports. One is used with the included USB cable to plug into a port on your laptop to power the fans. The other is powered and makes up for the lost port on your laptop and can be used for charging phones, etc. but doesn't offer any kind of connectivity to the laptop, in other words, your printer would not print if it relied on a USB connection to your laptop.

I like this one because it is rugged and also protects most of the plugs of the phone and also comes with 2 colors trims, white and black.
It is thinner than the cases i found elsewhere, and specially for people who carry phones in the pocket like me, is a perfect choice lightweight and it keeps dust and moisture out.

15478757,"I purchased another brand of sleep phones in a bluetooth enabled version for my husband about a year ago.  We've allowed our two children to use them on occasion and they found they are much more comfortable than any version of kid headphones on the market.  I wasn't willing to make the investment in bluetooth sleep phones for my 5 and 8 year old boys, so I looked for a wired version that was a little more economically priced.  These CozyPhones have had great reviews and I appreciate both the price and the mesh headband.  We just received them about a week ago and both of my sons are very happy with them.  I had to make a small adjustment to the size of the headband (i.e. I sewed a portion so it was a little smaller for their heads.) but that adjustment is temporary and can easily be altered back.  Both of my sons really enjoy using them and much prefer them over traditional headphones.  Definitely recommend.",5.0
432968,"I bought this product with a DI-514 WI-FI Router and was amazed at the low price.  The installation and encription setting was simple, but there was one thing I didn't really like.  The range wasn't the best that WI-FI can offer.  It had some dropouts as it reached 20% link quality (seen through D-Links great status monitor).  Although the signal did have to travel through a couple of walls the router was less than 100 ft. away.
I then bought the DWL-120 Plus and was amazed at the difference.  I was reaching 100% link quallity when before I only had 40%.  The DWL-120 plus is surprinsingly small (less than double the size of the DWL-122).  It also doesn't require an external power source.
So if you need some range or you won't be line of sight wiht the router use the DWL-120 plus instead.",3.0

I've spent the big bucks before on similar Incase covers, but they suffer from the same issues. I'm also a little rough on my cases, so your mileage may vary.

Cost aside, this is very nicely designed, with inconspicuous tabs that hold on to the edges of your laptop until you are ready to take it off. I've had trouble with previous cases without such a good hold.

Some them go back to the 1940's and the cardboard frame is thicker than the more modern slides and they won't fit into the frame holder, so be forewarned if you have a lot of these to scan. If the slide film has degraded from age there isn't much you can do unless you have software to edit them, with those you may have to send them off to a lab for digitizing. For the ""modern"" slides of good quality this copier is worth every penny! With a little experimenting (you have to use a good light source, I use a 60 watt light bulb in a reflective light ring plus how much to zoom in & out to get a nice framed picture), the resulting digitized photos are very good reproductions.

5135361,"The truth is I wanted an iPad and I have been watching the prices for the refurb iPads on the Apple store for quite some time.  Even refurbished, the iPads were too expensive. The A100 was the right price for me. Turns out that it is also the right size for me as well. I own an Android phone so I knew what to expect. My overall experience has been very good with this tablet.

One thing that I think I should mention is not really bad but may irritate some people: when I touch a link on the corners of a web page in the browser, the interface doesn't recognize my touch most of the time.  For example, the Yahoo mobile site [...] has 'MAIL' in the upper right hand corner of the screen. If you tap the 'MAIL' you may or may not (mostly not) be directed to the mail box.  I am able to tap the 'MAIL' hyperlink on my phone and consistently be sent to my mail box, so I figure it's the A100 touch interface that is the problem.  Not a big deal to me because I have alternate methods of getting my Yahoo mail but may get on someone else's nerves.

I am hoping that more apps will be optimized for the tablet soon.  I can download and install Scottrade Mobile on my phone but cannot on the tablet (the app doesn't even show up as an option to download/install when you do a search in the market).

2435804,"wow, what a bad set for me.  I have a (very nice) wall mount (an omnimount) and the set is mounted about 6' off the floor on an equipment rack.  Goal being, swivel one way to face my workspace, swivel another way to face the sofa.  So far, so good.  There's about a 15 degree difference between the line of sight from the workstation to the set and the sofa to the set.

Each time I move, I have to readjust the angle, so that the black pixels kind of lose their blue sheen.  In a set with a nominal 160 degree or so front view, I was NOT expecting huge color artifacts from a relatively small change in vertical angle.

This artifact is one to look carefully for in stores before you buy.  Viewed straight on, the Samsung and the Sony Bravia are comparable (and they're all so overtuned at the store, the colors mean less than the distortion.)  Get below the sets and look up, though.  The Samsung will look very blue across the black.  Pronounced and ugly.

If the Samsung will wind up being floor mounted or table mounted - at or below eye level - you'll be fine, and you may like the picture better than that of the Sony.

If it will be above your line of sight, do not mount it flush to the wall, and if it will be",1.0

It's perfect for my Bluetooth sports headphone. My headphone has a slightly thicker earbud, but the case still closed up pretty well. I found the mesh pocket to be useful for spare earbud pieces. Also, $5 with Prime shipping is not a bad deal for this case since a similar or more ""basic"" case at $1~$3 usually ships from China and will take weeks to arrive.

I removed the case from packaging, got out the super glue and reattached.  This was annoying but not the end of the world.  Next I opened the drawer which contains the index or disk location card.  It is opened by pushing the drawer in slightly which releases the catch and the drawer slides out.  Closing it SHOULD cause the latch to re-engage, only it doesn't.

So, if you get UNKNOWN or totally the wrong info, highlight that one disc on your TV screen, press the options button in the middle circle of the remote, scroll down to LOAD, press the middle of the circle to load it again. On doing this for ""Kickass"" it accessed Gracenote and a huge list of movie titles came up on screen, Kickass included and also Eclipse, complete with cover art and all the right details. You simply scroll down to the correct title and press enter, and it's done.

This also worked for some of my unknown titles (but not all - 3 of them did not have any info in Gracenote even loading them individually like this) - but 6 of the ones that initially came up as unknown are now loaded.

Just wanted to add this into the equation because I spent 45 minutes on hold with an idiot at Sony who didn't even know what Gracenote was, then went to their online help instead and a lovely woman called Mia knew exactly what I needed to do, let me complete the steps while she was online and hey presto, all worked fine.

10818841,"I'm not a Bose fan. I have family that has Bose products and I had received a Bose portable speaker in the past. It works fine for classical or opera, but I found that it neuters most other music making it quite bland. I prefer that the music I listen to has a little more bass. Not overpowering, but it should have some thump when the music calls for it. After reading some reviews this unit seemed to be something that might work for me.

Pros:
1. The unit is solid, not too big making it portable and not too small limiting its sound.
2. Good loudness/sound projection. Sound could be heard 25 feet away.
3. Buttons are a good size, clear but without breaking up the visual esthetic.
4. Worked with my iPhone 7, my older iPhone 4s and my iPad mini2. No problems transmitting music 25 feet away with clear view and no issues 15 feet away thru one wall.

Cons:
1. More of a nitpick. The unit is good for picnics and patio or pool parties. Its not the kind of thing that you can easily throw into your backpack and take on a plane. The size and weight brings with it some limitations. I found the handle to be more awkward than useful.
2. Now the sound...I found it to be extremely unbalanced. It seemed tuned only for highs and lows tending to drown out the mids. I found the bass to be muddy sounding and the highs pitched too far up. There was a definite lack of detail in the mid range.

The unit just sounded bad and was a big disappointment. Since I was looking for something in a home environment the portability aspect was not a big requirement just a bonus. I think I will instead look for a pair of solid bookcase speakers with more options for controlling bass and treble to adjust the sound to my tastes. Again its possible I got a bad unit, but I don't feel like sending another one back.",2.0

However, the mouse I received seems to differ from the model older reviewers received: there is no on-off switch and most unfortunately exhibits freezing issues that other newer reviews mention.

The product is very good. I would give it a 5/5. It's not a top of the line product, and I knew that going in. Can't compare a sub-$40 flash with something ten times more expensive. This flash works fabulously. I purchased it with radio triggers from Neewer, at the combination works seamlessly.

It has been 3-4 days now, and it still *might* ship in another ten days. Not that they are out of stock, because this page still advertises a delivery within two days.

I recently bought a fans controller and surprisingly the temperature remains relatively the same at lowest fans speed.  The only complaint i had was that installing this was a bit of a pain.  It took about 4 tries to set this on correctly.  They really should re-engineer the way you set this on the cpu.  A great example are some of water coolant setups.  You just push and lock, simple, painless, and no messy thermal paste to clean up or re-apply.

14697269,"The case is well built but it has one decent design flaw. Essentially, it puts the tablet in reverse landscape rather than normal landscape. As a result, some apps do not work as they normally would (e.g. the remote control app Anymote). Fortunately, there are third party apps that can force other apps to go into reverse landscape mode but it would be nice if I didn't have to do this. Regardless, the case is otherwise a good case.

CAUTION:
40 inches is HUGE, so be sure that this size will suit your needs as it may run the risk of being too much, depending on the size of your work space. I can speak for smaller sizes, but keep in mind my other reflectors aren't made by Wescott.

Let's get right to it, many folks will back away from this product due to the ""zipper"" issue. The two main reasons I held off from getting this was the zipper commentary and the price. So my review will focus on those two facets primarily with updates to come in the future.

ZIPPER:
Not a problem. Unzip every 12-inches and stop. Did I mention 40 inches is HUGE!! Put it into perspective, if you had a large waist and wanted to wear form fitting clothing, you probably won't be ""rushing"" your clothes on/off. Take your time (and not a lot either). I was able to get the outer sleeve off in less than a minute and put it back on in less time. No need to worry about putting it on the side you will use before the shoot in order to avoid looking like an ""amateur"". Take your time and get the job done right and you should be fine. When I get a moment, I'll try and upload a quick video.

PRICE:
I've seen other brands that sell 5-in-1 reflectors, but didn't want to skimp on an item that I would be using frequently. Maybe those zippers are terrible and have sparked this whole debate? As far as I can see, this product was money well spent. I have already recommended this to a friend and would buy this product again.",5.0

1857101,"I bought this armband because it was inexpensive and similar to the last armband I had. I plan to buy a new iPod soon so I did not want to spend too much on an armband for my current iPod. Also, I did not want to purchase the same one I had before since it eventually broke from wear and tear, and was more expensive.

I only use my iPod at the gym and, when I start to sweat, the clear screen steams up and makes it tough to tap the buttons on my iPod to switch songs, increase/decrease volume, and/or switch playlists. I also noticed my iPod would take a long while to turn on the next time I went to use it; I consistently had to hold down the middle and menu buttons and wait many minutes for the iPod to turn on (about 5-10 minutes). One time, my iPod never turned on and then, when it finally did, all of my songs had been deleted from my iPod. I had to restore the iPod back to factory settings (I think that's the correct wording?) by plugging it in to my computer and re-downloading from iTunes. Since then, it still takes a while for my iPod to turn on, but not as long, and some times the iPod skips songs or seems to pause before resuming play of a song.

I believe the condensation build-up is playing a role towards my iPod's slow reaction time to turn on/play songs and would not recommend this arm band to current iPod nano video 3rd generation users. If you don't have to wear your iPod on your arm when exercising and can tolerate holding it in your hand or clipping it to exercise shorts, I highly recommend doing that since the belt clip models have not caused me any problems.",2.0

18987123,"Pros: Low Power Consumption
Cons: Price

I have two of these paired to a synology DS214+ server with 16 cameras.  Each of them is connected to two displays.  They are designed so that one display contains all of the controls and the other shows just the camera images.  Its an expensive alternative to a computer, but they are designed to run 24/7 with very little power consumption.  One thing to watch is that your main display needs to be a real monitor (not a 1080p TV) or the controls will get chopped off. Not a big deal since you really don't even need the controls.  For the second display you can use a TV.  For exampling in the Master Bedroom I have a large TV mounted on the wall as a second display.  It is great to be able to flip it on and see all around the outside of the house.

Not sure what the other reviewer was complaining about as to hard to set up for internet access, etc.  The entire configuration is done on your Synology NAS in Surveillance Station.  You can even set up your display configurations (simple grid, big image in the center, cycling through cameras, etc) and push it out to the stations.  From the Internet you connect to the Surveillance Station on your Synology server.  This device is to display the cameras on the local premises, nothing more, so doesnt even need to be plugged in to see your cameras from the internet and there really isn't anything to configure on it.  Just plug it in, point your Surveillance Station to it and it works.",5.0

Global Cache has tools on their site such as iLearn which allows you to grab the IR codes sent by your remotes and iConvert which will convert the IR hex codes found on with a little Googling into formats used by this device. You could then use the free OpenRemote software on a Raspberry pi to design your remote layout or an Android App called Unified Remote to send the signals to your devices.

My only complaint with these devices are the pinhole sized IR receiver on the back that you read the codes from. It can be very difficult to get a read at times.

All I have to say is that people need to learn how to use their camera, stop griping, and problem solve. If you want a fancy camera that does a lot more than this one, be prepared to pay for it. You can't expect cream puffs for the price of jello.

That was until one port died a few months ago with a second one now dying.
This is the first linksys product I have purchased, and it has problems. Maybe it was from a bad batch, but a failure rate of 40% in less than a year is unacceptable. The general verdict about linksys is it either works for about a year or two or doesn't work at all. i.e. if you want reliability, don't buy them.
Trust me, I've config'd their BEFSR41 router and even port unblocking is a nightmare. That and getting supposedly ROUTABLE protocols working across all ports.

I have avoided the router and used a K6-2/450 as my ""router,"" a system whose CPU is about 100x more powerful than the one in the linksys anyway.

I have two Nexus 7 2013 so I bought two Poetic Slimline cases, both tablets were having a problem rebooting, particularly the one on black was doing it too often, the case cover has three sections that fold, each has a metal  and a plastic piece, so I took off the metal piece from the left side (that holds the top/bottom parts together), doing this killed the on/off feature but solved the problem, now I have to use the on/off button instead of open/close the cover.

It has to do with a magnet that is too strong for this device, as I read other reviews it seems like Poetic came up with a solution taking off the magnet from the middle section of the cover, but at the same time they might had made the base )that holds the tablet) too lose.

Update:
I purchased in August of 2014.  In April of 2015 my cameras began to have a problem with the IR cutout switch.  The switch would ""stick"" on filtering IR at night giving a fogged image.  I bypassed the IR switch which allowed decent night recording but with a washed out color during daylight.  For surveillance this was adequate so I didn't RMA the cams.  In December of 2015 the NVR lost power and won't power on.  Zmodo has rejected my RMA request as out of warranty.  Surveillance equipment should feature reliability.  I now must replace the entire system including re-cabling and remounting cams because of the proprietary Poe system.  I was just about to upgrade to the 1080P system after Zmodo support indicated I could still use my 720P cams with the new NVR.  I guess the NVR failed just in time to save me from another mistake.

pros:
fairly good images.  phone app works nicely on my samsung and htc smartphones.
onvif compatible
cons:
minimum 720p.  my asante 720p cam is actually higher res and it is noticable.

- Just as with wireless, you won't get the listed speeds.  I get about 30Mbps in one direction.  That's better than pretty much any real Wireless G connection.
- To work well (or in some cases, at all), all the adapters need to be on the same ""leg"" of your home's electricity supply.  In practical terms, this means all the circuits you use for this need to be on either the right or left side of your breaker panel.  If they are not, the signal must travel all the way to the an appropriate power company transformer and back to make it between adapters.  If you have a whole-house surge protector, it will block that from happening entirely.

What if doing this isn't possible?  Not to worry.  As long as you have a 220V outlet (like for a range or dryer) somewhere in your house, you can buy a signal bridge that will take care of the problem.

Like how cover fits snugly without adding bulk and no ugly straps. Yes, its not the best quality leather, but it has a good look and feel to it. Do like the fold over feature with the soft lining which is designed to protect the screen. When open, this has a much nicer feel while reading than just the bare plastic.

6635240,"I purchased this modem because Time Warner switched to using some products made by a company called ""Ubee"", and they are horrible. I have friends who lease these Ubee modems and we have two at my office, and they are very poor products, so when I signed up for Roadrunner wideband at home, I bought this modem and could not be happier!

I have had the modem online for over a year with only a few power-downs due to too much signal coming from the cable and I had to install an attenuator to limit the signal. Too much signal is bad, and this modem has a user interface which allows you to see all kinds of information about your modem, including the signal levels. This allows a person to see what is wrong if their Internet access goes down. Very useful!

The modem also gives me every bit of bandwidth that I am paying for and then some. I am paying for 30Mbps down and 5Mbps up, but I normally get 5~6Mbps up and about 35Mbps down. I have almost no packet-loss and this thing never goes down.

If you are looking for a regular cable modem without a router or wireless built into it, this is the one. I believe this modem works on Cox and Comcast also, but I am not 100% sure. Either way, it is better than the standard combo-modems and Ubee modems that are being offered now.",5.0

The least reliable and most troublesome Z-Wave device in our entire home automation system (more than 100 devices).  integrating the doorbell into the HA system is worthless with this device.

I've moved it around and it now resides within 10 fees of the Aeotec Z-Stick that is the central Z-Wave hub (Same company makes both products, so compatibility shouldn't be a problem...).  Have performed all sorts fo troubleshooting, but it's just a bad product.

We probably receive a three or four doorbell presses everyday (thanks in large part to Amazon deliveries!).  I was very excited to finally have a Z-Wave doorbell for integration with a home automation system.  This was not worth the wait.

The pushbutton is straight line of sight, through a window next to the front door and can reach the ringer unit, which is about 35 feet away.

I've had these, my first pair of video glasses, for a week now.  The widescreen strikes me as nicer than regular glasses.  The controls are easy to use.  Initially I wanted the raised characters on the buttons to be highlighted/colored: after a little use, I didn't need it.  The side pieces on the glasses are too short on me and turn inward enough at the ends that they poke.  The hinges move in many directions, allowing a large range of adjustments.  There is no way to tighten or loosen the hinges though, so my glasses shift if I jostle them.  Being able to use the AV310WA without wearing glasses, thanks to the +2 to -4 adjust, is great.  My son's eyesight is a poor -8, but he says the focus is good enough to at least use it.  Brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue are all adjustable and had a good range of adjustment.  Sound quality was fine.  The loose earpieces can be removed for when using with separate headphones (ear cup headphones may press the the side pieces in more than you like).

I really love this 54-inch S5430W-C2 model. With my new Vizio E60-C3 60"" (diagonal) flatscreen that's 54"" wide, I had the hardest time deciding between ""better sound"" with the 42-inch soundbar + sub, or if I wanted ""better looks"" with a soundbar that was the same length of my TV. (They are both about the same price.) I'm really not a big fan of heavy bass but was worried that the 54-inch S5430W-C2 wouldnt offer as robust/full sound as the 42-inch soundbar + sub. I *AM* particular about the way things look, though.

For my needs, I absolutely feel like I made the correct decision by going with the 54-inch S5430W-C2 model. It looks so good under my wall mounted TV. I already have a full Sonos setup for music throughout my house, so this soundbar functions as just an improved listening experience for TV and movies. However, I do believe that this unit offers great sound for all forms of entertainment including TV, movies, and music. I was expecting it to struggle with music, but Radiohead sounded very good, which is what I play on every speaker I try out because I'm very familiar with how they sound on my good speakers and earbuds. Pairing my iPhone with the soundbar and playing music over bluetooth was so fast and easy. I won't be doing this often but just wanted to see how it handled music.

In summary, this soundbar is a huge improvement over my 60 Vizio TV (E60-C3) internal speakers. It has a great remote for fine tuning bass, treble, center, ""sub"", pseudo-surround sound, and other things, but you can also just set up your regular remote to control the volume and never touch the soundbar remote after you get the settings dialed in where you want.",5.0

This cable draws more current than your standard USB ports are designed to to provide, which has a high chance of damaging your phone, your charger, or both.

18115004,"Durability:
They are cheap and they last about as long as one would expect them to given the size and price. These headphones last me approximately two months each and both failures have been for the same reason, the 1/8"" jack failed. That said, this is partly my own fault because I use these so often and am very rough on them. They are plugged and unplugged at least twenty or thirty times per day and are often wrapped around my iPhone in my pocket. I put these headphone through hell, so I am not really dissatisfied with them.

Sound quality:
Pathetic, these headphones have no quality when it comes to any type of bass. Fortunately, that is not much of an issue for me since the main purpose for me is listening to audiobooks and occasionally classical music while writing.

Comfort:
This is the one place these headphones shine. When combined with ComplyFoam Tx-200 tips, I literally wear these things for 8+ hours at a time with little discomfort. I often fall asleep while wearing them.

Final verdict:
Decent, and I will keep buying them because they are cheap and I don't worry too much about spending under a hundred dollars per year on replacements if they last long enough while I am in Afghanistan. If I knew of some other better quality headphones that would serve the same purpose and would last a year, I would get those instead. For now, I will stick with these.",3.0

I used to run on a treadmill simply because it tells you how fast, how far you have gone, and how many calories you have burned.  Not only does this Forerunner give you this information--on a large, easy to read while running display--but it tracks your progress and provides a training partner for you (something a treadmill doesn't offer).  In addition, the Forerunner doesn't regulate your pace like a treadmill.  This forces the runner to watch their own pace, allowing them to learn what a particular pace feels like -- an essential skill for anybody who runs in races.  A must have for anyone - whether you're just tyring to get in shape or are a serious runner gearing up for a race.

Although the key still worked intermittently, the keyboard was effectively rendered completely useless to her, and she demanded a new one.  Being the geek in the family, I was then tasked with finding her a suitable replacement.  I made the mistake of buying a cheap no-name brand that I thought would suffice, but after a few days I was told that it would not do at all, so I searched for another replacement.

Frankly, she missed the touch of the original keyboard which was one of HP's best.

However, with everyday use the Tech Grip material begins separating from the underlying plastic structure after about six months.  It doesn't stop, just keeps getting worse.

I purchased it a few years ago and used it occasionally for common data storage of our legal records for our five computers. I chose a Raid 0 for the two identical SATA hard drives.

The advice given by one reviewer to format the drives before installing them looks promising. I'll struggle along until I get it to work. Positive attributes: cost is low compared with the competition. Negatives: first, what's with the documentation. Developers: people aren't going to use the product unless its well documented and options explained carefully; I've had to do a lot of ""between the lines"" experimentation and I'm a unix programmer! Second: fix the fan problem -- this noisy fan grates on your nerves to the extent that I've had to sequester it to the basement and keep in always on (you can turn it off remotedly but not on -- so that feature is also worthless). The fans become quieter if you use foul language at them! Third: why are users forced to adopte the root file tree imposed on them. Having a ""public"" root directory is charming but obsolete. I found I could not rearrange the directory tree to my preferences. Fourth: it's usually hard to turn the thing off (again harsh language helps). I eventually resorted to pulling the plug instead of wrestling with the blue button on front.

My computer doesn't have a cd player and the documentation, software and drivers provided are all available on cd. I requested a link to the downloadable version of the required material and they got back to me with a link immediately.

The pi was unable to find the boot/LCD-show file because it wasn't unzipped within the boot folder. That may cause some people trouble so you may want to add that to the directions within the ""How to calibrate LCD screen"" documentation.

I gave it 4 starts because if I try to use my finger to touch the LCD screen it is not very accurate.

Several issues:

When I turn the car off, the bluetooth module stays on. So, when I park my car at home and then try to play a video on my phone, I have to manually switch over.

When I turn the car off and want to use my bluetooth earphones (Airpods), and choose them as my device, for *some* reason, it will unpair and then connect to this bluetooth module. In order to prevent this from happening, I have to open Settings on my phone and turn bluetooth off and on, or physically disconnect it from my car.

When I turn the car on, music automatically plays from my ""Recently Added"" folder and I have no control over turning autoplay off.
If I press ""pause"" on my phone, the music will pause in my car for a half second and then resume playing. However, pressing ""pause"" via my car's stereo does work. I have no idea why.

Almost every single time I go in the car and play audio, it will skip, sort of like how CDs used to skip if you shook the player hard enough. I can't predict what causes it to skip, and it does it sporadically. Sometimes the track skips three times very quickly, other times maybe once or twice a minute. It will mysteriously stop, only to happen again 30 minutes later.

10905962,"I got the white model and replaced the strap with a black leather one.

It does its job well: it vibrates very noticeably (intensity could be raised or lowered), it looks nice (after replacing the original strap that makes it look too childish or too 'loud'), and for the most part it looks like a normal non digital watch.

The bad: the black flat-tire-looking thing in the bottom that surrounds the led display makes the watch look considerably less attractive. I know it is to help the led display blend in more, but it is so unnecessary. I personally think it would look so much better if the area around the led screen would be painted white to blend in with the rest of the face, while leaving only the black led screen visible and contrasting on the face. This was the main reason why I debated so much between the white and black version of the watch, but I ended up getting the white one  instead. I wanted to be able to take the white one everywhere whether formal or not and still match what I wear.

Overall, I'm happy with the watch except for the black tire thing I mentioned above. I won't deduct any stars because of the front appearance because it's not enough to devalue how much I like this watch. I do recommend it, especially the white one if you can get over the black section on the face and if you could replace the strap.",5.0
10770757,"This case is very tough and durable on the outside, and the keyboard on the inside is the only ""mini"" keyboard I've used where I like the feel. It isn't as good as a good, full-sized keyboard, but for something low-profile and no bigger than the tablet, it's excellent. The keys are distinct, with a little distance between them and a tactile response to be depressed. Once the keyboard and tablet are synced the first time, they will re-sync again very quickly.

While agree with others that the rubber clasps that hold the tablet in the case are not as effective as they should be, just being aware of that has prevented me from doing anything that will cause the case to slip out. Once you get the hang of moving from closed to keyboard or closed to tablet mode, from from either back to closed, you won't have any trouble. I'd initially thought about putting velcro on the join area, but after a couple of days I realized it wouldn't be necessary.

244474,"The remote extender works great. You just have to take the time to position everything properly. I was hesitant based on the other reviews, but I'm a techie so I thought I'd give it a try. As long as you put the receiving unit where your remote(s) can see it and you put the broadcasting unit where the infrared light can hit all your devices you're trying to control it works great.

In my case, my A/V receiver, cable box and blueray are in a closet. I set up the broadcast unit and it was able to control 2 of the 3 devices.
The closet was kind of tight so the IR light didn't reach the 3rd device. No worry, I just used the included, wired IR blaster and put it over the IR receiver on the 3rd device and it all works great.

You just have to remember that the remote broadcasting device is shining (invisible) light on to your devices and put it where you imagine it would work. If there's no good spot where the light will hit everything, use the wired IR blaster for some devices.

What I really love about this setup is that I can use ALL my remotes. Previously, I had a universal remote that cost $450. It was fine for everyday stuff, but if I want to set up my A/V receiver or use another remote I was out of luck. Now, I can use all of my remotes which is handy for setting up gear or, in my case, streaming music. And, I bought a much less expensive universal remote (IR only) for $80.

this is a pretty good camera by my standards. its obvious that this is not an SLR so if you are looking for a cheap SLR alternative this is not it. the only real issues i have with this camera is taking photos in very dim light and taking photos with max zoom. these problems are easy to get around, by just switching between setting you can make the camera adjust itself to be more sensitive in dim light. a lot of people complain that they get blurry shots but its because they keep the camera in easy mode which makes the camera guess what scene mode it should be in and sometimes it guesses wrong. I keep mine in auto and pay attention to the shutter speed, if it becomes red then you need to raise the flash or change it to the proper scene mode. as for the problem with taking photos in max zoom.... i just walk closer to the object. over all i like this camera a lot and again if your looking for a cheap SLR alternative, nothing beats an SLR except a better SLR.",5.0

Cd Transport: Spectral SDR-3000
DAC: Spectral SDR-2000 Rev B
Headphone amps:  Krell KSA-5V/SMc Audio preamplifier, Ray Samuels Emmeline XP-7
Cables: Omega Mikro Macassar digital, Omega Mikro Planar Ebony Active RCA, Nordost Vishnu power cords
A/C: Furman IT Reference, #10g 20 Amp dedicated line

These headphones need very good upstream gear- I would suggest a source and that can deliver a full range sound, from the deepest bass to extended highs.

A dedicated amp is required for the 5000's to perform at their best.  Transient attacks, treble extension, and detail are hallmarks of the design.  A microscope on the recording with tremendous resolving power, but this headphone  requires careful attention to setup.  It is very easy for them to become bright and sibilant if connected to pedestrian equipment.

I use both a small battery powered amp as well as a pure class A power headphone amp with the Sony's, and there is to say the least a huge difference in the qualities that these headphones will deliver. The Ray Samuels Emmeline XP-7 amp, which uses 2 9V batteries provides transparency and clarity that lays any recording bare, but at times can be a bit unpleasant, i.e. thin and squeaky, depending on the quality of the recording. The mid-range and bass are obviously not as fleshed out and extended with this setup.

With the Krell KSA-5V, the 5000's will really let you realize the merits of class A power.  It can make the sensation of wearing headphones disappear.  You get the sense of space and air that the recording took place.  This combo is the most immersive, near virtual reality sound that I have experienced, conventional speakers included.

Criticisms of weak bass and bright or piercing treble is purely dependent on your setup, with the appropriate equipment, the dynamics and extension of all frequencies is without peer.

Both the Grado 325's and Sennheiser HD600's saw use for several years and I have found that the 5000's can combine the midrange and smoothness of the Senns with the explosiveness of the Grados while exceeding either model's strengths.

I am reminded of using Stax electrostatics with these. When everything has beeen optimized for this headphone, it will provide you with a unique analog like fluidity but with dynamic slam when listening to them. In a nutshell the MDR-SA5000's are a superior headphone, being the most neutral and transparent component for reproducing sound.",5.0

-Good fit/size for iPad
-Magnet hinge works well
-Easy set-up
-Dual position ""hinge"" is useful.

Cons:
-There are two raised dash marks on the ""F"" and ""J"" keys. I noticed that the raised marks left indentations on my screen. The cushion should be higher on all four corners of the keyboard to keep the screen from being pressed on the actual keys.
-There is a significant and random delay between hitting a key and having it register. In addition, the keyboard will at times register random double spaces which then subsequently inserts periods. The delay and the random spaces make it totally unusable at times. I have gone through all of the trouble shooting recommendations to no avail.
-Looking back at the other reviews it looks. Like there is a similar theme with the lag time, extra characters, etc.
-The outer case also scratches easily.",1.0
1549588,"I absolutely love this thing. My laptop is basically my child. Naturally, I was worried about it being placed on a stand. However, when I received the product, I saw how strong it was. I've been using it for about a year now and it's simply amazing. I never worry about it collapsing or anything like that. The space below is perfect for storing a keyboard while not in use. I always turn my Bluetooth off when I'm not using the keyboard, so I frequently type my password on my laptop keyboard while on the stand and it works just fine. It doesn't jiggle as I type, which is nice. It only moves a little under the weight of my wrists, although you shouldn't be typing like that anyways; I just have bad form. :)

The only ""problem"" I can think of is that sometimes I accidentally tap my laptop against the stand itself, causing me to cringe internally because I'm overprotective of my laptop. I suppose more cushiony pieces like the dots in each corner on the top would prevent this, but it would also likely ruin the aesthetic, so I'm willing to suck it up. :)",5.0

Insisting on 7 inch tablet that is a comfortable size for a reader, I considered all of the 7 inch models that were available at the time.  Each one seemed to have different features that made it a better alternative than the others.  What made me choose this one was the balance between the price and the features.  While I know it doesn't matter for everyone, the expandable storage was a major selling point for me, even if the specs were a little less than the competition.

So far, I have been completely happy.  The display is crisp and clear, and the sound is great.  This is a lightweight tablet that is easy to hold.  I would say the one downside is the backside is smooth and doesn't provide much grip, so the right type of case may be necessary for some.  I do not play resource-hogging games, so I can't speak for the performance of those apps, but as for the email app, web browser, and Kindle app (the 3 apps I use the most), the performance is excellent.  I would consider this more of a productivity tablet and less of a gaming tablet, but if that's the type of tablet you need, this is the perfect balance of price, features, and performance.",5.0

5858511,"UPDATED: since I posted my review, Anker's amazing customer service reached out to me, offering to replace the unit. We actually went through two more units before finding one with a reliable eSATA connection. What is interesting - and is noted in the product specifications included with the unit - is that the eSATA connection is actually rated *SLOWER* (3gb/s) than the USB3 connection (5gb/s). So, I am now upgrading my review to a 4-star rating, as long as you have a USB3 port to properly leverage this dock's speed.

First of all, it's tough to beat the price on this dock. And, I was very pleased with its USB3 performance (148MB/s write, 156MB/s read) with my 4TB Seagate Barracuda 5900rpm drive. That's impressive.  As long as you have a USB3 port to leverage the maximum speed, you can't beat this dock.  The eSATA port (which I had to go through 3 units to find one that worked reliably) is actually rated slower (3gb/s) than the USB3 connection.

If there is any slight criticism of this unit, it is the non-hardened finish of the protective plastic door that is scratched the first time you insert a drive. But that is just a minor cosmetic issue.

For some reason, it's not easy to find a good, reliable external drive dock these days. For almost 2 years my OWC Newer Technology Voyager Q dock was rock-solid through its eSATA and FireWire 800 connections. Based on reviews of that model and its super-high failure rates, I must have been lucky to have mine fail ""only"" 18 months into use, and outside the warranty replacement timeframe. Thinking that the issues would have been corrected, I ordered the latest (USB3/eSATA/Firewire800) of the Voyager Q only to find it dead-on-arrival with a completely non-working eSATA port.

Enter the Anker USB3/eSATA docking station. For half the price of the Voyager Q you get a super-fast USB3 connection but no FireWire800 port for legacy Macs. But its price and reliability, combined with amazing customer service, are enough for me to rate this a must-buy as long as you have a USB3 port to leverage its speed.",4.0

I saw the same boxes at Office Depot for much more; so for this online price, order one or two extra in case all of the boxes aren't cut correctly.(Another reviewer warned about this, too). Also, there are slots on the front end for little cards to identify the contents of each box, but be aware that you'll have to fit, cut, and make your own - cardstock or this is not included.

But I would tell anyone now to get this computer.  And make sure it has the Intel Core i5 processor.  I wouldn't get anything less now a days.

Some of the reviews had not so great things to say about the touch screen.  I really can't boast about it.  I mainly got it because I thought it would be cool for my 2 year old.  Who could do things like draw with it and things she wouldn't be able to use the mouse for.  It is a little slow.  But I didn't expect it to be perfect.  And I rely too much on my mouse and keyboard to use the touch screen on a day to day basis.

The two things I haven't been a fan of:

1.  The computer tilts back a little too far.  I like to have a monitor more upright.  So, I have a small book that props the back of the computer up.

2.  The build in video camera.  It's fixed.  I thought it was going to have some sort of toggle to be able to move it around.  It really doesn't.  So, it's fine if you're just sitting at your desk.  Not for your kid running around the room trying to Skype with their grandparents.  So, I still end up having to use my (detached) Logitech camera.

8481627,"These are not meant for the  Grado sr80i, but I thought I would try them. They allow the headphones to get off of my ears, and the foam keeps the pressure off of the ear completely (unlike the s-cushions). So far I find it more comfortable. The speakers are also not covered by the foam of the s-cushion, and the circum-aural design supposedly creates more of a soundstage.

I am not an audiophile and have not tried to compare in detail the sound to the s-cushion. I could listen with either type of cushion, they both sound fantastic to me. I am likely to use the G-cushion more due to the comfort factor. The G cushions don't push down on the upper ear at all, which is what I think I like about them more. The s-cushions are still comfortable, just different.

  The foam is good quality, firm, yet still spongy. I don't know how they compare to the pricier name brand, but they must be close. These are a worthy upgrade for the price and hopefully the foam lasts awhile.

UPDATE:
 I have still been enjoying these as an alternative to the s-cushion. I was looking at the original Grado G-Cush online, and notice that the ear zonks are not shaped exactly the same as the Grado brand.

And it looks like the grados are probably a different material, and may be a deeper bowl. But I have no idea since I don;t own the name brand ones.

She's still playing around with it, but so far is totally in love with it.  She has a grand kid that is graduating from high school this spring, and I wanted her to have some modern and easy to carry around.  She still has an old VHSC camcorder from the early 1990's that is not the best at taking movies.  This way she can just hook it up to her computer and use the software that is installed on the camcorder and burn movies to CD or send them to people via e-mail.  The only 2 unfortunate things that I didn't care for, is that it didn't come with any memory.  Had to buy her an 8GB HDSC memory card.  The microphone isn't the best.  May have to get her an external microphone to hook up to it.  I also purchased an extra battery when I ordered this.

It's probably a bit pricy for what it is, but it looks good and looks like it will offer good protection along with the tempered glass screen protector I put on. I probably would have been fine with just the screen protector and the silicone case if the case went around the full frame, but it's open on the left side for this cover to attach via magnet, of course. The magnet seems strong enough; not so strong that I'd want to yank the cover, but strong enough for every day use if you treat your electronics with care. I've tried sleeves too, which work great, but don't offer much protection when the iPad is out... Next time I might try a front and back cover because I'm a bit afraid of this magnet deal.

Pro tip: when you plug in the annoyingly proprietary Surface power connector, make sure that the cord is facing DOWN.  If the cord is facing up, the screen brightness will flicker and the dock's USB ports will probably not work.  I almost returned this thing before figuring that out.

It keeps the Surface charged, plays happily with the dongle for my wireless keyboard/mouse, and reads thumb drives with nary a hitch.  I am currently using one of its mini display port outputs to display the screen on an obscenely large TV via a converter cord- this works very well.

I've also also used the dual mini display ports to connect to dual monitors via mini display port to HDMI cables- this works well; no complaints at all.  I haven't noticed any latency issues or flickering with typical PC usage (e.g., Office productivity software, 1080p video).",4.0

Type in youtube search ""BMW E46 3 Series '98-2006 - iPod"" and watch the installation process.
After i received the product i connected it once in the trunk to see if it works. After that i ran the wires to my desired ipod location (arm rest) and it was done. I recommend this product because it is very easy to install, you can change tracks by steering wheel up/down controls, your ipod is still 100% operable and you can do whatever you like with it while connected to bmw. Both steering wheel controls as well as ipod navigation work simultaniously.
Other ipod kits that cost considerably more, give features like text display, instead all of them tend to freeze, have delays up to a minute or more. None of the text display capable ipod kits are delay free like this kit. Other downside of other ipod kits is that you must program them. Ther are 2 programming features:
1. If you wish to have text display and steering wheel controls then your ipod won't be operable, it will say on ipod screen: ""ipod connected""
2. If you wish to change tracks directly from ipod and navigate it then your text display won't work as well as steering wheel controls.
No static sound in this ipod kit.

I was also surprised to find that there is a Program feature, which allows the user to choose ISO, White Balance scene mode, color settings, metering & shot modes. There are no aperture or shutter speed modes, but I'm guessing if you're looking at this camera that's not a problem. I own several digital cameras of varying cost and size, but I wanted a camera that I could toss in my bag or jacket and know that I was never without a camera (without the added bulk to remind me I was always carrying one), but at the same time took decent quality photos & video and this fit the bill.

Sound Quality-
Amazing, your speakers will come alive with out having to push the system hard at all. 11.2 speaker system(you can add 4 more speakers & an extra sub)
Set up-
So easy to set up and EQ the speakers my son could have done it.
Inputs-
You have everything you need, plenty of hdmi, wifi, bluetooth
Remote-
It comes pre-programed to work with you cable box so no need to worry about set up and finding the remote codes
Note*Even though this is an 11.2 receiver, you do not have to add 4 celling speakers. They have a configuration that will properly allow you to add 4 regular speakers. You can even just run it as a 7.1/.2 system and it will sound amazing. I am running it this way right now and just love it. But I will be adding in the 4 other speakers to the ceiling very soon.

Volume level on the dock resets to default way-too-low levels every time you pull your iPod off it, so when you put it back on to play it, you must turn up the volume via the remote each time.

Well, I am typing this review on this set hooked up to my GTX 960 and must say they are very, very wrong.

Pros:

- It pushes 4:4:4 @ 60Hz over HDMI 2.0. The colors are gorgeous. Text is VERY sharp, even in contrasty situations and with no scaling. (please note: only HDMI1 is capable of this. The other ports are not)

- Viewing angles are great!

- The black levels are very good, I don't know what people expect from a sub-$500 TV, but I can't imagine expecting anything darker.

- The colors (when calibrated) are fantastic! I do a fair amount of photo and video editing and I'm incredibly impressed. I used to use Dell Ultrasharps, but this has replaced them.

- Motion is handled well, especially if you use ""game"" mode. Even without ""game"" mode, Battlefield 4 works great. If there is lag, I'm just too slow to see it. You can very occasionally see some IPS ""ghosting"" if you go from very dark to very light scenes, but it disappears quickly and is a small price to pay for the color rendition and viewing angles.

Cons:

- Port placement is dumb. All TV's should have side-facing ports, not back-facing. Had to redo my mount to avoid crushing the cables.

- Web OS is very sluggish. I don't use any of the TV features of this, but even adjusting the picture is a laborious process.

- Stupid LG ""joystick"" button on the TV itself. Very difficult to use.

- Bezel is a bit large for 2015/2016

- The feet of the TV are VERY far apart. If you're not mounting this you'll need a very large console to put it on.

8088448,"This product did not have many reviews when i bought it. And compared to big brands like Belkin or iHome, I had never heard of this company before. Because of the low $21.95 price (compared to other mounts) I thought it was low quality so was very hesitant in buying, but it wasn't and I'm really happy i got it!

Pros:
+ Entire arm is metal (from the picture i had thought it was black plastic but was pleasantly surprised)!
+ All clamping mechanism is very sturdy. I have mine vertically clamped to the top of my bed's headboard (I use it nightly ever since i got it) and it has not even moved at all.
+ Total arm length is 1 foot + mount. Mount is held to the end of the arm with a rotator cuff mechanism. So it virtually has unlimited positioning angles.
+ Mount's cradle is all rubberized on the inside, therefore when i put my iPad Air in it, I'm comfortable knowing it will not be scratched.
+ Overall excellent construction quality.

Cons:
- Have not found any yet. I have owned this mount for a few months and everything has been good but will update this review if anything negative arises.

Conclusion, after intensive search here on Amazon (reading reviews + product descriptions) this is the best mount I have found for my iPad Air Tablet. I would definitely recommend buying.",5.0

That laptop served me very well for 7 years, but it had recently begun overheating, lagging much more than usual, and just couldn't keep up with a lot of websites, including Facebook. This laptop does considerably better at all those things, with several added bonuses.
First of all, it's got a back-lit keyboard. That's very convenient, especially since I have trouble seeing the letters in my dim-lit room. I did end up changing the settings so the lights go off as soon as I stop typing, because the backlight is a bit bright.
It has an ambient light sensor, which adjusts the screen brightness depending on available light. This is convenient when using the laptop outside, or when moving from one location to another.
It has a few USB 3.0 ports, which were absent on my old laptop. I have a few things which use this, like my backup hard drive and my camera. It's nice to have higher read and write speeds where available.
One of my favorite features is the built-in SD card reader. I always had to use an SD card adapter before, and they seem to break easily, and a few of them have even corrupted my photos. This is so much easier to use. And if you've ever forgotten to bring a card reader with you, you know how frustrating it can be, especially if, like me, you take a lot of photos and like looking at them on the computer.

6694659,"This is by far my favorite out of the 5 or so iPad cases/covers that I have tried. The main reason is the texture and feel of the material. I consider the iPad itself to be far too slippery in my hands, and most cases do not help this problem. Even the rubberized cases can feel like they are going to just slip through my fingers. But this case is different - the material has just enough of a ""grain"" to it that it feels really secure and pleasant in my hands.

The functionality of this case is great. My favorite position is portrait reading position - with the front folded back on itself and wrapped around, so the folded cover becomes a comfortable hand-hold for one-handed reading. I also use the landscape display position (high angle), for reading or viewing videos. I was initially concerned that the cover was too stiff, and that it would tip over forwards in this position - but after a short break-in period, it works great. The landscape typing position (low angle) works great for doing email etc, although I don't use that position nearly as much.

4808612,"I guess I've had this cover for a few months now, and since I keep thinking about how much I like it, I figured I should post a quick review. When I first received it, I had the initial impression that it might be too small, thin, flimsy, but as soon as I snapped my Kindle into it, most of that initial impression disappeared, and today it's hard to imagine a better cover. I have come to LOVE the smallness of the cover as it seems to add nothing at all to the size of the ""nude"" Kindle, yet the top part of the cover (that covers the screen), which once seemed so insubstantial to me, now feels wonderfully solid and perfectly sufficient to me. The felt on the inside (which protects the screen) is perfectly incorporated into the product, and the cover folds behind the Kindle for reading (perfectly folding back all the way). FYI, I got the ""purple"" cover, which I would have called maroon or burgundy, but I'm glad it wasn't really purple. My only complaint is that the light shines directly into my eyes if I hold the Kindle at the wrong angle, but this is easily resolved by simply not holding it at that angle. It's very nice to have a light that doesn't flicker or lose brightness, and that doesn't need its own batteries, and although the light must shorten the battery life of the Kindle slightly, it has never been noticeably significant. I usually charge the Kindle weekly anyway just because I like to keep the Wi-Fi connection turned on (for keeping my reading position synchronized with the Kindle for iPhone app, and in case any OS updates are released for automatic installation).",5.0

Ive tried replacing the battery in it, but it doesn't seem to help. Also, the little speaker in the hiro is a bit quiet. Id say its loud enough for most situations. But you might miss the alert if your car radio is on, or something like that. My last gripe is the reduced battery life on my phone. I used to leave bluetooth off. But now I have it on constantly for Hiro, and it really eats up the battery, maybe 15% faster than off. Comes with the territory I suppose.

5986979,"I bought this item to replace my other case.  It appears to be very sturdy and I love how the Kindle is completely encased to keep it safe and secure (as opposed to the corner straps that held it into the previous case).  It's seems to be of very good quality (especially considering the price) and it is slimmer (width wise) than my previous case.  The elastic band keeps everything tightly closed with no risk of opening by accident in a bag or purse.

Having the Kindle in the vertical position in the most upright notch, seems like it might make it a bit top heavy, but it can still be done with care.  The fact that the Kindle can rotate may pose some 'getting used to' but the benefit far outweighs the adjustment.  I am slightly concerned about how secure the snap attachment is that attached the full enclosure to the case.  I love that you can take it off the case and still feel the Kindle is safely protected but repeated removal and replacement may put wear on that snap.  Only time will tell.

Also, when in 2.4Ghz mode I'm pretty sure the mouse latency is less than the other wireless mice I've tried (even other ones using 2.4Ghz proprietary dongles.)

The mouse felt noticeably more sluggish in Bluetooth mode, although that could be a flaw on the receiving end or just a technical limitation of Bluetooth in general.

The only (minor) complaints I can think of are:
1. The keyboard seems to turn itself off if you leave it idle for a while, so I had to turn it back on a few times.

But this one is a bit of an odd release for Canon as the Vixia Mini X is not what one would expect from a traditional camcorder.

First things first:  this is mostly a fish eye camera with a very wide angle lens. It lacks the ability to zoom although it has a mode to switch off the fisheye image to get a 'zoomed' image - but that comes at the expense of image quality.

It also lacks easily accessible manual controls for exposure, and it currently isn't possible to control focus manually. I had a very hard time determining what was in focus in Macro mode as I couldn't control the focus myself nor could I see the screen well enough while outside to make a determination. Even a 'touch to focus' feature that's now common in most camcorders and smartphones would have been more useful.

As others have noted, the camera is potentially useful for vlogging and musicians - especially given that the audio hardware is decent on the camera.  Compared to similar super wide angle action cameras the audio is light years better. It also has an external microphone port for bringing in other audio sources.

Image quality is ok, but not game changing. Low light performance is behind that of other camcorders and gets worse when switched out of the fisheye mode.

The bottom line?  I'm really not sure who this camcorder is for. It will be of use to a very small market segment that is looking for very specific features. But it's not an alternative to a traditional camcorder for most consumers.",3.0

This has happened to me on more than one occasion while using the system on very familiar routes using different settings.  When the unit was set for fast route which means fast roads not fastest time it took me on a route that was not the shortest time route.  If you set it for shortest route it will provide a shortest distance route which may not be the shortest time route.

I called Navigon and spoke to their technical support and general support people.  They were unable to provide a solution to correct the problem.

This was very disappointing since I know Navigon is a very good and respected supplier of GPS systems in Europe.  To bad they did not wring out all the kinks before rolling this out in North America.

Tried to use the right Firmware: Could not detect it. Plugged it in a usb3 port outside of my motherboard instead, firmware still didn't recognize it. I used the right firmware, and just about every other one on that page with no avail.

Installed it windows 7 on an empty drive, and tried dual boot. Still facing the same bulls***. I also tried running virtual machines to see if they detect it, unfortunately VMs have standard drivers for the make of it, so in the end I realized it was pointless.

Unfortunately, the only USB3 PC in my house I have is the one I've souped up.

Anyway, problem with it is that I tried 4 usb devices, and it only detected one of them. That's why I assumed it was a firmware error. I tried every port, same problem. I have yet to use the card reader, and I read people were having trouble themselves with the old firmware.

Anyway, the extra star was only given because it did detect one of my USB sticks, but now it's just a semi-operational drive bay enclosure that *sometimes* works.

Once logged in anyone can add or delete files in their account. Also, nothing is clear and concise. There are many folders containing files and more folders as well. Duplicate files too. Really unorganized. You can't even batch download the files. You have to download each item one at a time.

Some months ago the HD and other connections started getting flaky and disconnecting for no apparent reason.  Then very recently, I couldn't get 4 of the ports to work for any device, the blue indicators would not come on, nothing.  Tried rebooting, moving things around, a different laptop, etc., nothing.  Time is money, plugged in an old 4-port USB 2, re-did the research, ordered another one to replace.  Today things magically seem to be working, so jurys out.

The instructions that come with the modem are short and clear. If this is your only modem, it does have a web interface and a self-activation feature. However, my situation was different as I also have phone service with TWC, so I needed to retain my current TWC modem for phone service AND have this modem for internet. (Even though I'm still using their modem for phone service, TWC no longer charges a lease fee for the modem.)

The install process was still simple: we used a coax-splitter on the line, then called TWC support and the agent was able to activate the new cable modem, reconfigure the TWC modem and make the adjustment to billing. Even with the phone call, the whole install was less than 45 minutes.

2845240,"Decent workstation keyboard, but I cannot recommend this for gaming.

I originally purchased this keyboard in about 2007 near the beginning of my college career and when my PC gaming was at an all time high. To its credit, I'm actually using the same 8+ year old keyboard to write this very review, but it has found a new home at my workstation (i.e. not my gaming rig). For word processing and home desktop use, this keyboard is more than adequate. It looks sleek and modern with keys laid out exactly as expected. The multimedia settings are a welcome and convenient addition. Illumination has has 4 settings: off, bright, medium, and low. I used to appreciate illumination when I used this keyboard at home, but in a well-lit work environment, it doesn't hamper or aide in any way.

The keys themselves are similar to a notebook's membrane keyboard, but they feel more firm and clicky instead of spongey like a notebook's and feel like they have a little more travel to them that a notebook's. I believe these are scissor switches, and if I were to judge how these felt in relation to Cherry MX switches, I'd say the tactile feedback and clickiness is closest to the Cherry MX Browns, though the activation point is at the bottom of the switch while the actuation point is at the top.

For gaming, I do not recommend this keyboard. It does not have n-key rollover, so if you press multiple keys at once, it will be one or the other. The most common situation would be crouching and moving forward in an FPS game (e.g. L-Shift + W), in-game my character would either crouch, or move forward, but not both. When I originally purchased this keyboard in 2007, I didn't realize it was an issue with n-key rollover, so I went off and purchased as second K740 thinking the first one may have been defective. Of course, I ran into the same problem with the second keyboard. For that reason, I've since switched to mechanical keyboards with unlimited n-key rollover  (Das Keyboard Professional S).",4.0

I have been using a Wacom Intuos Large at my work and wanted one for home, BUT those wacoms are really expensive and for the life of me they just plain don't play perfectly with windows 10.  Dont get me wrong, they work, just not fully to my liking.  Anywho, back to my review for this product:

The good:
- Responsive, and the pressure sensor is great
- no batteries needed in the pen
- comes with 8 extra tips for the pen and a pen holder
- the software is easy to use and the buttons on the pad as well as the pen are all customizeable
- the pen is really light compared to the wacoms (good in my opinion)
- pen does not have that grippy rubber on it (personally if you are using a pen, lose the rubber grip.. just feels better)
- the price is what i would expect one of these to cost
- large enough work area for me with 2 screens

Cons:
- usb cord is only like 3ft long
- I'm not completely sure about this; does not have a precision function that i know of (little box that lets confines the pen to a small area while using the full pad)
- no eraser function on the opposite side of the pen, but a button can be programmed to switch to eraser mode (dont really use it on the wacom though)

It's installed in my parents' bedroom, and they like it. Just keep your expectations in check. It's not for anyone who really appreciates high quality sound. It sounds more like a 2.1 computer speaker system, but obviously it has a lot more style. There just isn't enough space in the bar for better quality drivers. I was actually a bit disappointed with the sound when I first turned it on, but hey, it was only $47.99. For the bedroom of a non-audiophile, it's perfect.

I took one star because it has a big, ugly power brick. I wish every manufacturer used integrated power sources, as Apple does with the AppleTV, but maybe this thing is just too small for it. But they could have used a slim wallwart, can't they? Anything is better than a power brick.

I like the wired subwoofer. If you see reviews for soundbars with wireless subs you'll notice a common pattern: The thing goes to sleep and you have to power cycle the bar to get it to reconnect. A wired means one less thing that can fail. I also like the auto-power on when connected via Optical. This works well with the AppleTV. The wall bracket is pure genius. It's very easy to put the bar in place and take it out. It doesn't include screws for the wall, so you have to provide your own.

I didn't like the powerbrick and the proprietary connector for the subwoofer, which makes it a big inconvenient to add more cable if you prefer your sub out of sight. Also, take into account that the driver in the subwoofer is exposed, so if you have small children they might damage it.

I'd recommend this for a bedroom of someone who is not obsessed with crystal-clear sound. My mom thinks Logitech 2.1 computer speakers sound great, so she's more than happy with this in her bedroom, but for the living room I'm happy to have a full-fledged surround system with two subwoofers.",4.0

-$$$$$
-Feels a little cheap

The cover feels a little cheap, although anything made from plastic usually doesn't feel amazing.  It is made in the USA, a really nice change!  It's a little pricey, but I don't mind paying a little extra for American products.  I have an Otterbox cover for my iPhone that I love, so I have a lot of faith in their products.  It looks nice, but the screen cover is a little strange.  It works well as a stand though.  I'm sure this will be more durable than the thin snap on cover I had before.  The real surprise was the sound port.  I was skeptical, but it does a great job directing the sound.  It's hard to block the sound no matter what position it's in.  Really nice feature!

I asked, ""Why does my other Roku2 work perfectly?"" However, I went through the drill and contacted the router manufacturer and they did what she had asked.  Still did not work.  Another chat produced nothing. I asked, ""Could there be something wrong with this Roku?  I had not read reviews until later to see that this is a common problem.

1612148,"Screen was a good price and a nice size upgrade from my previous 92"" screen (older Elite screen Silver Frame EZframe). Screen I received has a slight streak/defect in the screen material near the bottom center, ~ 12"" from the bottom, which only really shows on the screen in bright scenes. I can live with the slight defect. It has 2 piece horizontal frame pieces because of its size, the pieces fit really tightly together and because of the black velvet material on the frame you don't really see a seam. I do notice the the 2 piece bottom horizontal frame piece joins together in a concave fashion, where the seam in the center is closer to the wall than the sides, the top did not do this and looks like one perfectly straight frame piece. The slight concavity of the bottom didn't seem to affect image quality though, after focusing the projector there was no issue with any portion of the screen being out of focus, all of the screen was nice and focused when looking at the pixel structure right next to the screen.

Image quality is a noticeable step up from the 92"" with my projector setup (Epson 8350 with screen wall painted flat black.) With the larger area and mounting it ~ 12"" off the wall, bringing the throw from 15' to 14', the contrast detail is noticeable better. The 92"" was too small an area for the amount of light the projector was putting out (in theater black mode even) and as a result both shadow and bright highlight detail was lost. With the 110"" size screen the detail is very good in dark and bright scenes, like it should be. It lost some brightness compared to the 92"" screen, but honestly the 92"" image was TOO bright for the Epson 8350, which was why the image quality suffered. 110-120"" is an excellent size for a 1080p projector and 110"" was the largest I could fit in my living room. Overall I like the quality of the screen (though I would rate the 92"" screen I previously had better due to the single horizontal frame pieces and perfect screen material.)

I bought 2 of these cards, one for each of the new Samsung Galaxy S7s purchased. I figured, EVO SSDs are very good, and a Samsung card should work perfectly with a Samsung phone.

Fast forward 2 months. First card corrupts while installed, lost all data. Go to reformat it, nope. I removed the card from my phone, placed it in a card reader to reformat, nope. New partition table? Nope nothing. I figured, well I'm not going to waste my time doing an RMA on a single microSD card, until about 1-2 months later when the other phone's card did the EXACT same thing!

It's not the phones, they run other cards just fine.

I attempted to RMA both cards back to Samsung Canada, only to be stonewalled from the original web CSR. They kept telling me the warranty is the stores issue (it's not, 30 days in store, standard warranty remaining which on these cards is 10 years) I took the chat transcript to the store I purchased from, and when they finished laughing, they again stated the obvious. It's Samsung's issue, though the manager informed me, he has come across bad batches of this card, had one himself.

Next I'm talking to a CSR (barely, English was definitely not a well known language, and they took my details, and released an email address to send a copy of my receipt in.

If Samsung cannot make good on something as small as their sd cards, what about their next exploding phone? my contract is up next year, at this point, I doubt it will be a Galaxy. nor will my next TV, or computer products.

But if you are migrating over to Apple to take advantage of the apparent bargains to be found in the professional software arena (Music Production, Video Production, Graphic Arts, etc.) I am issuing a warning that Apple is lying to you.  Apple has implemented an aberrant pricing policy that varies widely from the industry standard pricing policy for professional software.  Apple, in true corporate fashion, has made this change without warning or notice.  The new policy is NO PATH TO UPGRADE.  You heard me right.  If you pay professional software prices for a piece of Apple software, and two months later they release the new and improved package, you will be stuck paying full price for the upgrade.  Do you feel like you got a deal now?  You have now paid more for your software than if you had gone with the industry leading software package (PreSONUS, Adobe Premiere, CorelDraw, etc.) and next update, you will be well behind the pricing curve.  I do not have a problem with Apple software, but rather the sneaky way in which they implemented the pricing policy.  If you are buying Apple to take advantage of these apparent deals...save your money and stick with a PC.  You will pay more initially for your software, but within a year you will be saving money.",2.0

The highs aren't as airy as I'd like, but these cans have a pretty good EQ set along on them. The bass is very nice; it's not overpowering but it is very clear. You can sometimes feel these vibrate right on your ears because of the bass. They aren't as attractive as beats, but they're close. Very stylish! I love the ability to change the band, I just wished I would have custom made mine!

Compared to Beats, these are definitely better and obviously more affordable. I say if you are thinking about getting these, look no further. I'm sure if you EQ'd these, which I'm going to try once I get my cable, these could be set up even better than they are ""stock"".  My only issue is that Lee needs to take a page out of his old company Monster and improve the cables. I pulled my cable out the wrapper, plugged them in, pulled up on the cable coming from the 3 button remote, and pulled it out of the gluing. It worked to begin with, but after about 30 minutes, it did not work. I'm contacting customer support to see if I can have it replaced.

Pros-
Excellent battery life. Have been using it on a regular basis while running.
Sweat resistance good. Comfort fit.
Bluetooth connects well to ipad, Linux machine as well.
Availability of Local Micro-SD card for music (reason I selected this product)
Nice sturdy case.

Cons-
Delayed responses. After 1 week, on start takes a while till one hears anything.
Local Micro-SD card use - In this mode, start out well but in 5 seconds disconnects with an error message then re-connects back in 5 seconds. this happens always on startup (got used to the pattern now). Runs fine after this initial hiccup.
Couldn't connect via Bluetooth to Surface tablet for some reason.
Skipping song has some issue (related to indexing I guess) prior song repeats  ( I stopped using this feature)
at times, had trouble connecting unit directly to laptop( windows 7) for music transfer.
* Sound quality satisfactory (in comparison to other outdoor use Bluetooth headset like JBL)

Tested radio feature which worked well ( I rarely use it though)

The price was right at $89.99 so I figured what the hell?  I got back to my house and took a couple of quick shots and noticed that even when standing and holding the camera very still, it took a blurry picture.  Remembering that I had my tripod in my vehicle, I tested it out and found that it still took a blurry picture when zoomed.  The video quality has a lot to be desired as well, which is odd since it supposedly takes HD video.  I do like all the settings, and it does take decent pictures without using the zoom function, but all in all, it is still a Fujifilm product which to me isn't the best of products out there.  For a cheap, yet functional camera that takes decent pictures for a point and shoot, I would totally recommend the A560 by Canon.

Installation: Fairly idiot-proof. There's a link for instructions on the decal but it's very straightforward.

Some installation tips: If you have a decal like this with a lot of thin ""lines"" it may not lift when you peel it - just carefully put the wax backing back on and rub all over/where the thin ""lines"" are to generate some heat and it'll stick to the adhesive and lift completely in one go.

In my town, Fresno, there are freeways that it says stop when they don't, and it directs you off of freeways and into heavy traffic. I had a another GPS over a year ago that had these freeways on it. I now have the NUVI 350, and it has all of these freeways. If Garmin knows they are there, why not upgrade the 2730? I had the latest update. The 2730 took forever to find a satelite, and I missed the battery power. Each time I turned the engine off, I lost my route. Not great for my typical five hour trips. I do miss the Satelite radio, even if the quality was only so, so. I miss the weather reports, but not the traffic. Even in L.A., and San Diego, the traffic info was not great enough to count on. They did not even have the Central Valley on line. The first time I called Garmin they took several days to get back to me. The next time I got them after being on hold about 30 minutes.

528684,"I've used this pair until recently I've purchased a Senn HD280Pro. After hundreds of hours of listening I came to a conclusion that the 515s had a too bright of the upper and upper mids. It is still a great headphone to listen to and to produce audio with but I recommend for certain genres of music popular nowadays along the lines of rock/metal/dubstep.
Classical music sounds pretty decent on these cans, but again the highs are a bit harsh, just a little bit.

Overall a great phone, I'd normally recommend anyone with a tight budget to grab themselves a pair of these but I don't think they make this specific pair anymore. I originally bought this pair for about 60 dollars, now its almost a $100.
I suppose the HD 518 would be a better buy at the moment, for similar to slightly better sounding performance.
I have not used the 518s yet so I cannot say use your own judgement to choose between the two.

6437761,"This is an okay backpack. It works for what I need it for but it is definitely not perfect, and not worth the high price tag. I do like that it has many pockets for organization, and the laptop pocket is great,  but it's a stretch to try and fit more than 2 college textbooks and a few notepads in the main pocket without having to cram them in there.
The reason I only gave it three stars is due to the terrible design of the water bottle holder. The very first time I went to use it the water bottle retainer strap it broke (Bad quality control, I barely even pulled on it and the cord pulled right out of the stitching). Ever since then I have been using the pocket without the cord and if you barely even tilt the bag your bottle will fall out. This has happened to me many times and I should have learned by now to not use that pocket, but I also shouldn't have to avoid using this feature as it was a big influence on my decision to get the bag in the first place.
Normally I don't write reviews but I just dropped my brand new hydro-flask out of the bag while getting it out of my car and now it has a huge dent and I'm super bummed :(  I have owned multiple OGIO backpacks in the past with the typical mesh water bottle pocket with the elastic band on top and never had any issues. But this design sucks.
So for the price I paid for it I wish it would have had better quality control and a better design (at least for that pocket).",3.0

Even if you use this wire, as I did, on a perfectly flat baseboard, you will encounter creases, and air bubbles. Adhesive is strong, so if you use on pre-painted boards, if you peel of to realign wire the paint will rip off.

You will not match the color perfectly and there is a shade with copper lines being different from the rest of the vinyl sticker backing it. As others have mentioned it is challenging to peel back the white vinyl away from copper wire. You must use a sharp razor and take your time.

5202193,"The Good:

- Great sound
- Surprisingly stylish
- Slide in/out mouthpiece ensures you won't lose your mic piece ever again
- Comfortable with a smart and flexible head band
- Works well with iPhone 4, so that you can answer phone calls and get back to listening without taking off the headset

The Bad:

- A learning curve involving the tiny switch that controls calls and music controls
- Music can be heard outside the headphones

The Bottom Line:

First let's talk compatibility of this headset:

The remote and mic is supported by iPod Nano(4th gen and newer,) Ipod Classic (120GB and 160GB,) iPod Touch(2nd gen and newer,) Ipad, Iphone(3GS and newer.  The remote only, but not mic is supported by iPod Shuffle(3rd gen and newer.  However, Audio itself is supported by all iPod models.
This is a great set for your music needs.  A slide in and out mic piece is great.  If you don't need it, just slide it in and don't worry about losing it.  The thin cord is about 3.5 feet in length.  Learning the remote may take some time as different combination of clicks do different functions(click once to Play or Pause and fast-forward requires two click and a hold.  Headband is flexible and very comfortable.  It also long hair-friendly and a flexible band can hold the hair back and not let it escape.  I also found that music can escape and be audible by whoever is around you.  While this could be a plus for some, it can certainly be annoying for the rest of us who are not interested to hear what you are listening to.  Overall a solid choice if you often find yourself using an iPod and computer equally.",5.0

 - Makes iPad Mini 100% waterproof
 - Easily accessible ports
 - Even with a screen protector, the screen still reads your fingers all the time

 - Volume, lock, and rocker buttons still work

Cons:
 - Headphone port is deep, so if you have headphones where the connector goes in at 90 , you may have to try different headphones (my apple ones work perfectly though)

If you are someone who loves to relax in the tub, then you need to try what I call ""TubFlix"".  It's Netflix in the bathtub.  Obviously our electronics are not so friendly with water, but with this case from Ultraproof, you can take your iPad anywhere you want.

Upon first putting the case on, I still felt a little hesitant that it was waterproof.  I have had the LifeProof case before and I felt the same feeling with that product as well.  It' s just strange to think that your device is impervious to liquid.  After a few days, I began to feel comfortable knowing that my iPad was completely protected.  I usually soak in the tub with my iPad resting on the edge of the tub and after a few times of it falling into the tub with the case on, NOT A SINGLE DROP OF WATER was found inside the case.  I have gotten to the point now where I will comically soak my iPad just to see the faces my friends and family make.

The case does not feel very cumbersome, in fact it's pretty thin in comparison to most iPad Mini cases.  The only thing that I do like is the rocker switch.  It's kinda hard to change the setting but luckily on the iPad, it's a button that really isn't used often.

You can now change this but I have found that any alteration from the factory settings just makes things worse.

Foscam, what this camera needs to make it a PERFECT camera is better audio function.  The volume for both sending and receiving audio is WAY too low.

I don't read the instructions, still haven't.  I always thought you jammed these things in your ear canal.  They come with the medium set of soft rubber cups attached.  They sounded okay.  You know how if you push the earbud farther into your ear with your finger, they sound a little louder, and the bass seems to be a little better.  Well, I switched to the smaller set of rubber cups, thinking they would go farther into my ear canal, thus sounding better.  Hello in there.  Oh shxt, no bass at all, Alvin and the chipmunks singing.  So, I tried the largest rubber cups, what the heck.  Funniest thing, the bass was fantastic.  Evidently, they work like little subwoofers in your ears.  I didn't jam them in my ear canals, but they did seal off my inner ear to the outside world.  I'm using this with a Touch 2g, equalizer off.

If you get these and you aren't getting crazy bass and great highs, before you hit the equalizer, try the big rubber cups.

I've realized that if you have a case that comes in over the front of the phone to provide a little lift from the screen, then the case may push the protector in from the sides and therefore resulting in loss of sensitivity along the edges of the screen. However, if you get a slim case, that doesn't come over the front, then it works like a charm and the case will prevent dust from going into the protector through the sides.

7991283,"I bought this unit because it was just about the only one in the $100-dollar price range. I previously had a Tom Tom (as a gift) and knew a friend who used a Magellan (also a gift). Both gave out at the same time. I had hoped to find a website that compared GPS units in easy to follow terms, but no luck.

So far, Ive used the Garmin twice and had no problems with directions. I follow voice commands, so for me that is the Garmins biggest drawback. There is no choice but to accept a female voice that is flat. Both the Tom Tom and Magellan had a choice of voices, which made traveling, especially on a long trip, fun. Garmin offers free cartoon characters on the Web, which doesn't exactly fit my needs. If there were vocal choices, I'd give this five stars instead of four.

The Garmin screen is bigger and brighter than the Tom Tom I had, and is also easier as a touch screen. Is it better? Id say yes, except for the lack of voices.

Its true as other reviewers have noted that nothing comes in the box. The .PDF manual is about 12-14 pages and prints too close to the left. If put in a binder, the text on that side would be cut off. The map download is a lengthy process, but I had no problems using XP.

The particular graphics card I purchased was made by Saphire Tech.  With two GPUs on board, this is like two cards in one.  Take a look at the 3DMark6 and 3DVantage scores for this card, and you will notice that no other graphics card beats it. Although it is expensive, I got a great deal from Amazon because one of their partner companies failed to live up to their offer, and Amazon stepped in and sold the card to me for the same low price(relatively speaking, of course.)

Cons:  This card isn't cheap, but you get what you pay for (as my son always says.) Also, it runs a bit hot when stressed with temperatures approaching 100 C, but so far this hasn't caused any problems, because most of the time the card isn't maxed out.",5.0

The one in the picture separates mid-bass and tweeters (hi-pass + low-pass) with gain control. This will result in tweeter impedance applied in parallel with mid-bass impedance making it too low at high frequencies. Besides if you decide to keep stock speaker it will keep on producing distorted highs and mids making the sound much worse than it could have been.,2.0

This computer case allows just that! I now have a computer that does not look like my neighbors computer. This case provides color and texture to my computer. The case snaps on with a few finger tabs, and does not block any of the ports or the keyboard! You can plug things into the computer without having to worry that the case will be in the way. It closes nicely, and the computer is still easy to open, which is exactly what you need with a case! The padded top and leather-like bottom give it a nice look. The inside of the case appears similar to many plastic color cover/cases I have seen except with the nice feeling material on the outside. The padded top is very nice looking, the almost quilted look is very nice. The case is not see through, so you do not see the apple logo when the computer is open/on. But I think seeing it through this patterned/textured top would be strange. The plastic inside of the cover base has vent holes in it, but the leather-like material does not. I am not sure if this will impact its head dissipation or cause it to retain too much heat. I guess time will tell with that one.

So if your preamp or receiver has no phono input, you can plug it into any AUX input.  There are many used records on the market for as little as a dollar or so(as well as new ones still being produced).  This turntable coupled to an integrated amp makes an affordable package.  Get some good monitor speakers and you will have a fine music system.  Check out the small speakers from such companies as PSB, Polk, and Monitor Audio.  Find a used integrated amp from NAD or Cambridge Audio (or buy a new one for around $350).  For less than $1,000 you will have a music system that will be satisfying for quite a while.  I love the turntable.

Neither adding exaggerated ""warmth"" or showing ""sterility"", they do what IMHO a headphone (or speakers for that matter) should do: present music as it is recorded, neither adding or removing anything. If the recording is flawed, you'll hear it, but in well-done music you will be treated to a precise, open  soundstage that will remind you of why you love music in the first place.
Build quality is quite good, and I find them comfortable over long periods.
They require some decent amplification to get the most out of them, so use a decent headphone amp with portable audio players.

16326701,"The Disney Circle is a good tool for a home with multiple devices that need parental monitoring.  In our home, we have a mixture of devices that are used by teenagers and elementary grade students.  If each child has their own device this product works very well.  However,  we have one laptop that is shared by the elementary students along with teenagers and adults.  Disney Circle is unable to distinguish who the user is and so it limits the device at the setting you set specifically for that device. That is a weakness of the product's ability to filter.

Another weakness is that the IP spoofing technique of the Circle, formally known as ARP spoofing, introduces some challenges for modern browsers.  For example, there are many pages from Yahoo, Espn, Amazon that are linked to an ad which then redirects to the actual page.  That redirect is not handled well by Disney Circle and the result is that it says Page Cannot be Loaded.  I see the issue happen across the three modern browsers of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

The Strengths of Disney Circle are its highly customizable filtering.  I love how it can control Youtube's Restricted Mode which cannot be manually disabled.  It is very simple to setup which took less than 3 minutes.  When pages are visited that are restricted by Circle a friendly page will be displayed such as ""You've been filtered"" or ""It is past your bedtime.""

2910312,"Invisible Shield is great. I've been the proud owner of an iPod Touch for over a year. Last year, I purchased an Invisible Shield to protect my iPod's screen. The protector held out for the whole time, and stayed in crisp condition. The adhesive stuck and held tightly to the screen and you could barely notice that there was anything on the iPod. There were no bubbles that appeared at any time whatsoever for the whole year. When comparing the feel of a normal iPod or iPhone's screen to one with an Invisible Shield, the one with the shield felt slightly ""rubbery"", if you will. This rubber feeling is no problem at all. The touch-sensitivity of the iPod isn't affected by the thin layer over the screen, plus the rubber ""sticks"" to surfaces, so if you put your iPod face down on a desk and tilt the desk, it won't easily slide off. If you take the iPod from a cold environment to a warm one without the shield, the screen fogs up, and you have to repeatedly wipe the condensation from the surface. The invisible shield more or less retains the iPod's heat, and I've noticed that when I come inside from skiing, from example, the iPod never fogs up and keeps crystal clear. Application is a bit of a precise exercise. After applying the Invisible Shield ""liquid"" to your fingers and the adhesive backing of the shield, you have to be careful applying it to the device. The more liquid applied to the adhesive, the easier it is to move the layer around, but the longer you have to wait for the shield to dry. It is easy to remove and re-apply the layer. I took my first shield (after a year of service) and removed it from my screen to replace it. Then, after I applied my new one, I applied the old one to my friend's iPod Touch, and the layer stuck tightly and is now protecting his device. The only downside I have found is that you can get deformations in the layer. Things that press tightly against the shield can slightly alter the application, creating divots. They blemishes are hardly noticeable and don't interfere with touch-sensitivity.",5.0

I should have read more reviews, and not just the favorable ones.  The critical reviews on this product as well founded and in retrospect, I wish I had forked over another $20-$30 a pair and got headsets as good or better than my cheap, old Philips headset.  To those reviewers that say ""they sound great"" I have to wonder what their standard is for sounding poor.  Like listening to music in a garbage can.

Pros:  They look ok, they are lightweight, and fold up nicely.

I couldn't get in one FM station that sounded even reasonable.  The reviewers that complain about the buttons is dead on.  You have to remove the headset to properly locate which function button you want to use.

I like that the charger comes with a car adapter, so now I always have the charger in my camera bag so I can use it while driving or when travelling.

8184262,"After looking at a lot of alternatives, I settled on FLIRC to control my new Macbook Pro retina using my old white Apple remote.  Using FLIRC I am able to start/stop movie in Quicktime Player, start presentations and advance forward and back in Keynote, and I can increase and decrease the volume system-wide.  This setting also allows you to go forward and back in PowerPoint, but the play button doesn't start the slide show. It was a bit trying to get it to work because the f10 &f11 cannot be assigned to control the volume, so this should save you some frustration.
1) Plug in FLIRC
2) Dismiss/ignore any prompt that tells you about an unrecognizable keyboard
3) Open FLIRC app
4) It should default showing the minimalist controller layout (left, right,up, down, enter, back)
5) DONT press the GO! button to start the automated process
6) Click on the green left arrow and then click on the left direction on the remote
7) Click on the green right arrow and then click on the right direction on the remote
8) Go to the controller menu and select MEDIA KEYS (this refers to media keys and not just a 'media computer' like it suggests)
9) Click on the gray play button and then click on the play button on the remote
10) Click on the gray volume up button and then click up on the remote
11) Click on the gray volume down button and then click down on the remote
There you are done!
Remember once you program it, like shown above, you don't need to launch the app anymore. The FLIRC device itself will store the settings.

I noticed that Powerpoint 365 uses shift command return to play the slide show. If you wish to map the MENU button on the remote to start your Powerpoint, here is how you do that
1) Go FULL KEYBOARD under CONTROLLERS
2) Click on the gray virtual keyboard shift command return
3) Click on the menu button on the remote,  this should allow you to start Powerpoint presentations using that button

Since it's more powerful than the prior radio I was worried about it stressing the speakers too much but it hasn't given me any trouble there. I'm especially pleased with the USB iPhone controls - though the display is small and has to scroll the text, I have no trouble locating what I want to hear. (I have a Verizon iPhone running 4.2.6 so I was concerned about that, but no problems.) The lighting on the face isn't too obnoxious and I like that I have a choice between red and green.

This design is fairly classy and minimal, which was also a concern because the majority of after-market stereos look like a mess.

A lot of reviews are stating this thing doesn't work with their older iPods. It worked with every model of Touch for me, the previously mentioned iPhone, a 3GS, a 3G, and a Classic from three and a half years ago. I checked the manual and it seems the cutoff point was around three years, which is completely reasonable. The only thing it didn't work on was my buddy's iPod Touch, but that was because he stupidly spilled water on the bottom.

These remotes are better than the one Microsoft currently sells for one simple reason - the older, larger remotes made when the X360 was first released pretty much mimicked a Windows Media Center remote.  The newer, smaller one on sale now is missing a whole slew of buttons - the most important one being the STOP button.  If you use the DVR functionality of WMC that's almost a deal-breaker, and it definitely lowers the WAF of the whole experience.

If it's for main storage, I'd backup what you don't want to lose and not get comfortable with it.  I've used Transcend in the past and had great luck with that brand.

It has combined our TV, satellite system, DVD, and surround sound system in to one control and has worked flawlessly. The only thing that kept it from a perfect score was the small number buttons on the bottom. It is a little tough to keep from hitting more than one at a time.

The headset is overall a good pair of headphones. They will give you a good sound, not a lot of bass but good treble.

3561991,"Definitely not your typical Kodak... easily 4.5 Stars out of 5

At $140, including delivery from Amazon, a fantastic bargain in a compact tele-zoom camera. With 12.1MP and 10x Optical zoom lens you get an effective 35mm-350mm focal range performance.  Real solid build quality - only thing missing and found on the higher-end priced competition is a true ""wide-angle"" lens.  Kodak should also consider upgrading to a higher quality resolution LCD for the live-view, especially noticeable in bright lights or direct sunlight since there's no view finder alternative.  No need to worry or compensate for exposure or image quality - take the pix - trust it, you'll not be disappointed by the result.

Takeaways:
- ergonomics are good but somewhat bulky; however given the optics and capable P-A-S-M feature sets included (i.e. Program, Aperture priority, Shutter priority, and Manual shooting modes) makes this compact tele-zoom a terrific bargain and value
- especially liked the molded handgrip feature and material used in construction which aid in ease of use and feel
- camera showed very good resolution and detail in both still and HD 720p video, though in poor lighting the AF tended to be somewhat hesitant to respond
- battery life is good but Kodak should have included some type of SDHD card in the packaging since you need to purchase it separately and the internal memory quickly fills up with only a few pixs taken

But all of that aside for the moment, as it is, this is so far beyond anything else I've ever experienced. I was wary of this being a Virtual Boy 2.0, but that is not the case at all. Google's low-cost ""Cardboard"" headset was enough to keep me occupied for awhile, but it was also so enthralling that I wanted more, and the Vive's ""room"" experience totally delivers on that.

3078431,"I bought this lens before a recent trip to Australia. I've been using the 18-55mm that came with my EOS and a Canon 22-200mm. The 18-55mm suits 80% of my needs normally but I find that I use the telephoto a lot when traveling. So this lens replaces them both. I still brought the 18-55mm with me but 90% of the time I had the Sigma on the camera. It worked very well. The zoom is smooth and the autofocus worked well. The few times I needed to use manual focus I found the focus ring fell right at hand and worked well. I took 2000 pictures in a variety of conditions and the images look great. It was especially handy for wildlife shots.

One downside is that it's a relatively slow lens (f-stop). I can't really call it a complaint because I knew what I was getting and a faster lens is quite a bit more expensive.

The image stabilization seems to work well. I have not tried any comparisons with it on or off yet--I left it on the entire trip. However I did take several hundred pictures during a whale watch cruise. The seas were rough and the boat was moving and I was at maximum zoom taking photos of whales breeching. Everything worked a treat. Of course some were blurry but most were razor sharp.

The only 'complaint' is that the lens is heavy. There's a lot of glass in it, so that's understandable, but it gets to be a pain in the neck (literally) after a while. I'll be looking for a better strap next. When carrying the camera, the lens ends up hanging down. After a while it loosened up enough that it would extend on its own. I started using the zoom lock and have begun to build up the muscle memory to unlock it when I bring the camera into position. Unfortunately, the lock button is very close to the autofocus button and on several occasions I flipped that while trying to lock or unlock the lens. Not a big deal, though.

Overall I'm very happy with the lens and the pictures it took and the price was quite reasonable.",4.0

2) Unboxing and setting it up was very easy. I used a Hdef antenna at first. I was upgrading my Directv to hi-def, but when they showed up, they wanted to put a large dish on the front of the house. So, I called Comcast who setup hi-def cable . The picture performance with Comcast and the antenna were great.
3) After about two weeks I noticed a couple of black lines on the screen which grew from a few inches to a complete vertical line in a few days. It was noticeable even when the set was off. I checked online and read comments here. I chose to have Samsung come out and replace the panel. The panels were on backorder so it took about a week for them to show up. The tech was really good and explained everything. IMHO I think it was probably the better route changing the panel rather than sending back for an exchange. The set has been performing very well since the replacement. I give Samsung an A for service; I created an online ticket on their site and then called. They followed up with calls a number of times to give me status.
4) With a set this nice, I unfortunately :-) had to invest in some peripherals. So I bought from Amazon a new Onkyo HDMI receiver, Klipsch speakers, plus some cables, and iPod stuff. I like the setup and watching a DVD or HD movie/sports is pretty impressive.

This switch seems to be very well made with a metal housing, clearly labeled lighted switching buttons. It sits sturdily on my computer desk held in place with four very effective rubber legs and will not move at all when I depress the switching buttons.  I, also, like the cable design of the unit since all the important connection points are in the back freeing up desk space.  There are, however, two extra USB 2.0 inputs located in the front of the box to be used for a printer or USB hub or whatever. My son, who is a mechanical engineer, came over and tried it out and was very impressed with this product. He said that it does exactly what it is supposed to do with a no nonsense effective design.

12063762,"Very disappointed.  I have previously purchased two refurbished Linksys units.  They were E1200s, and were purchased when Linksys (consumer) was still under Cisco ownership.  They have performed flawlessly for many years.  Several weeks ago I purchased an EA6300 certified refurbished unit from a 3rd party seller.  It was unable to retain settings (i.e. I would set the SSID, and the SSID would mysteriously reset after rebooting a couple of times).  I thought the issue might be that the 3rd party seller was getting bad units, so I purchased this certified refurbished EA6200 from the official Linksys store on Amazon.  This one is a disaster as well.  It was unable to connect with the internet.  I called Linksys support.  They initially tried to tell me that they would not support this unit because it was refurbished.  After pointing out to them that Linksys was selling EA6200 refurbished units right off its own website, the rep put me on hold, spoke with his supervisor, and came back on the line and agreed to try and help.  After jumping through some hoops, he was able to get me onto the internet.  Unfortunately, after hanging up with him and relocating the router to its permanent location, it once again would not hold an internet connection following a reboot.  I gave up, packed it up, and sent it back to Amazon.  I am not a computer idiot.  I run a small business, do all my own IT work, and am generally good with PC issues, networking, etc.  Suffice it to say that this was a bad unit.  Two bad units in a row is more than a coincidence.

3619203,"I have only had one problem with this box since I got it, and that was that when I was using it with a flat panel that I wasn't sure it was compatible with, I couldn't tell by looking at the box that the power was on. I think that was because the power button doesn't look like the sort of power button that lights up when the power is on. Of course once the power IS on, you can tell.

I could also object to the quantity of preloaded software, but I am using it with XBMC Linux so it doesn't matter.

I installed XBMC Live onto a USB stick by using UNetbootin with the xbmc.iso linked from the Lifehacker blog. UNetbootin doesn't change the syslinux.cfg file to reflect that you want to boot from USB, so you have to change that file's ""boot=cd"" text to ""boot=usb"" whereever it occurs in that file. After you make this change, you can use the stick as a LiveUSB install.

I also upped the graphics chips' ram to 256K. I haven't upgraded the system RAM to allow the graphics chip to use 512K.

Installed/configured as above and booting from said USB stick, the box and XBMC plays  very cleanly over gigabit Ethernet from the file server (Samba).

Sound: The sound is base heavy and very clear. Exactly what I was looking for in a new pair of headphones.

Fit: They fit snug and never fall out while I am running or working out. They come with multiple sized ear tips and the company will send you as many as you need should you lose the rubber tip for any reason. (Side note: Sol Republic customer service is incredible, they are trusting and very helpful. If something breaks for whatever reason during warrantee they replace it, no questions asked. At least in my experience.)

Charging: These headphones went from low battery to fully charged in under an hour. I was able to play music and talk on the phone for about 6-8 hours without having to charge them. So you should have no problem using these all day at work or school without having to worry about running out of battery.

Controls: Easy access volume control buttons/pause and call answering.

However the fairly large and jumbo sized XL buds this X-1 provided makes a GREAT seal. The material used in the earbuds are very flexible and high quality. The wetter the better seal.

However the downside is sometimes when removing the earbuds from the ear might have the buds stuck and it can get tricky to remove it and reattach to the headphones.

The cords are not as flimsy as the cheap ones. I suggest you wrap them around your ear. Most of the problem I experienced with ear buds become loose during swimming is due to the movement of the cords leading to the buds. Sometimes repeating tugs would eventually loosen them and might end up falling out. What I suggest you to do is wrap the cords leading to the buds around your ear, you can swim all you want and they shouldn't become loose.

As for cleaning I usually rinse out and shake any water lose. Sometimes they do get stuck inside the buds. You don't want that.

Overall this pair of earbuds sounds good, fits comfortably and built sturdy. Give them a try and skip the cheap ones.",4.0

6362375,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She hasn't really used it much so far because she is only 12 months old and I don't let her use my iPad much yet other than for FaceTime with Grandma.  When she does use it she seems to like it because it makes the iPad easier to hold and it has three flat beads at the top she can play with.  It also has some flaps on the back which will give the iPad a slight incline but don't actually prop it up like a kick stand would.  I do like that it has a protective cover for the screen and can  be used to cover the home button on the iPad, or not, depending on which way you insert the iPad into the cover.  Two things I don't like about it are that I feel like I have to be very careful with it when the iPad is not in the case because the cover feels very flimsy and I am afraid that it will tear very easily.  I also don't like that I have to use a coin to open the case in order to take the iPad out or put it in.  I wish there was a more convenient way because I don't like having coins in a convenient place in my house with a 13 month old running around.",4.0
18794835,"Before I ordered this item (I have the black version) I read the TWO star review about this player SUPPOSEDLY damaging CDs. THAT TWO STAR REVIEW IS NOT ACCURATE. How do I KNOW? Today I received my TEAC CD-1000 CD Player and tried it out MYSELF. What I found is this: yes, the thing that comes out that you put the CD on does NOT come all the way out as alleged by a previous two star reviewer......but it comes out at least 3/4 of the way or more...which is PLENTY OF EXPOSURE ON WHICH TO HAND PLACE YOUR PRECIOUS CD'S........you will have no trouble or difficulty UNLESS YOU ARE SOME TYPE OF ""KLUTZ"" WHO DOESN'T WATCH WHAT THEY ARE DOING OR WHO THROWS THE CD ONTO THE CD SHELF FROM YOUR LISTENING CHAIR! Other than that you would have to purposely missplace the CD for any damage to be possible. That's the truth---no, I don't work for TEAC.

The other reason for this review is that this CD Player is VERY GOOD....EVEN EXCELLENT in my opinion...and in the opinion of The Absolute Sound Magazine who wrote about an earlier model, The TEAC Reference PD H-600 .....selling for the same price as this one..... which The Absolute Sound placed it on ""The 2013 The Absolute Sound Magazine Editors Choice List""----- and the magazine review stated---and I found this is also true of this newer model: ""It is open and easy...immediately engaging, transparent, and refined in tonal balance...the bottom end is powerful and tuneful..it renders a fine sense of a concert halls depth and breadth...it never sounds digital (harsh)"". I can add that it ""images"" very well in that it gives an excellent sense of instrument placement across the left to right ""sound stage"" between your speakers. I even compared this to the famous OPPO CD-105 which sells for $400 more.... and I like this one better!

Shooting in continuous mode gives good speed for large fine JPEGs, but for raws w/o JPEGs the speed drops below usable rate once the buffer is full.

A small annoyance, which I guess is unavoidable with the SDHC & CF form factors, is that the SDHC card is inserted 90 degrees to the direction in which the adapter is inserted into the camera. That means replacing an SDHC card requires taking out the CF adapter first.

At the moment I am trying unsuccessfully to ""kill"" the Duracell batteries I charged with this unit by taking continuous pictures with my digital camera...but the batteries just refuse to die.

The camera in question is a known battery hog, and kills alkaline and Eveready rechargeable batteries alike after only a few shots.  So I'm absolutely delighted that I can take tons of shots with the Duracells and the batteries remain strong.

I wonder if the reviewer who claims his Duracell batteries began to die rapidly is suffering from a memory problem.  It's a popular misconception that NiMH batteries are immune to this phenomenon.  You have to use the batteries until they die, THEN recharge them.  If you don't drain them completely, they develop a ""memory"" which causes the kind of problem the reviewer indicates.

Nor, for that matter, should it be a complete surprise that this charger prefers Duracells to Eveready batteries or other brands.  Batteries and chargers are sometimes specifically engineered to work together.  (Look at Anton-Bauer.)

This unit has the cover and back as one unit, so it doesn't come apart. The cover still has a magnetic clasp, and nicely turns the iPad on and off when opened and closed.

6912111,"To say that my last 3 days have been horrible is an understatement.  I purchased an Onkyo NR717 about 2 weeks ago, set it up, and it sounded good, but something was missing.  I could not put my finger on it, but the sound was a little muffled I thought.  So, after arranging to send the Onkyo back, I went to Best Buy and bought the VSR-53.  I was told that it was a new 2012-2013 model, but after I got it home and called Pioneer for support, they told me it was a discontinued 2011 model.  That didn't go well.  So today for the second time I packed up the receiver and took back to Best Buy.  I purchased the Elite SC 61.  I also bought something that is a real life saver - Banana Plugs.  I suggest these for anyone who has to navigate a speaker wire into one of the posts in the rear.  It took me hours yesterday to wire in my speakers;  took 5 minutes today.

I needed a receiver that could pass-thru the TV signal so my wife could watch TV with the TV speakers rather than turning on the receiver every time.  Although I did not get to it yet, Pioneer assured me that all their 2012 Elite models had the pass thru option on them.

I have had it up and running for only a few hours now, my but initial impression is very good.  I will come back in a few days and let you know how it is going.

Beware of one thing, and I confirmed this today with Pioneer:  They DO NOT authorize any internet sales of their ""Elite"" class of receivers.  If you buy one on line they will not provide any warranty with it.  I assume they do so as it allows the walk in stores to keep the prices high.  I have seen many being advertised on E-Bay.  Just beware.

4187553,"This device is just what I was looking for.  It streams internet radio, plays music from a thumb drive, built in FM radio, and plays shared media from your PC.

Controlling the device with the remote is very easy and works well, but if you use the controls on the device itself, it's quite clunky and not fun, in my opinion.  Set up is very easy and it found my wireless signal right away.  Creating internet radio favorite folders and stations is very easy using the vTuner website that links to your device.  Some stations have spotty reliability, but the strong stations are great.

I'm not sold on the range yet.  Our house is not huge and we have a bit of an issue with it getting a signal from one upstairs corner to the downstairs opposite corner location of the router.  I need to play around with this set up and see what the issue is.

A big con for me (but there is a work around) is playing files from our PC.  The device sees all my folders, but once I start clicking into those folders, the device locks up (I'm assuming while trying to read the info within those folders).  The work around is to create playlists and play the music from there rather than from the folders.  And it works that way, but it would still be nice to just find that one song you quickly want to play for someone.

One other con is the display when it scrolls the internet radio station name across.  It isn't smooth.  It's kind of uncomfortable to look at because the characters sort of fade into each other.  Hard to explain...just wish it was a smoother scrolling display.

* Has 4 rubber feet to keep it from slipping.
* It has 2 retrieving legs that prop-up the MacBook in the back, at an Enhanced Viewing Angle & for Ventilation.

Having said that, I really like these headphones. I have taken them on long trips, e.g., a 12-hour flight to and from Asia, and they have been very effective in reducing the tiresome jet engine noise that reaches my eardrums while allowing me to enjoy the in-flight video/audio service. In fact, when I wanted to sleep, I simply left the switch on, and even without any audio output, this headset made it so much easier to rest for the effective noise cancellation property.

8221513,"We were hesitant to order this little speaker but it is amazing.  The sound that comes from that small speaker is enough to fill most of our house.  I really didn't expect the sound that I'm currently listening to to come out of there.  I'm a little worried about the construction though.  I have the feeling that if I collapsed and opened it a lot, it may break.  With that said, for the cost, this is a great buy and I would recommend this to anyone that wants loud, quality sound on the go.  Perfect for any kind of cookout or outdoor activity.  Runs off the power of your ipod as well so no need to plug it in anywhere.  It also comes with the cords needed to connect to USB or Ipod and a nice little carry case.  Great product!

3999825,"I ordered these headphones because I wanted a good pair of reliable sturdy and affordable headphones. As a college student, I cant really invest in 200-300 dollar headphones (although the quality is worth the price) but these headphones turned out to be a great alternative. First of all, they are Sennheisers. The difference from using regular apple ipod white headphones to these headphones is like comparing laptop speakers to full sound surround sound. The bass has great response although it could be better. I am writing this review on the basis of its low price. For ~$20 they deliver great quality. The mid tones are clear and crisp and the bass is rich. The bass could be better but again, these speakers do not have an independent power source. The audio cable jack is extremely long. I believe its about 15 feet. They come included with a cable reducer though, which sometimes is a hassle but not too much. The one and only complaint I have with them is that after ~45 minutes of use, your ears become hot. They are not uncomfortable but sometimes they can get too hot. They are quite comfortable though. There is padding on the upper side of the headphones and the construction of the headphones feel like 100 dollar headphones. For the price, the quality is amazing. I would recommend this product for someone who wants to have the headphone experience but not if you want professional sound. Great product",5.0

I am amazed that each individual half still operates well as a monocular, although I have to manually manipulate each half's focusing mechanism; with the central focusing wheel destroyed. This speaks to the strength of the tubes which hold the lens groups in place.  I love these binoculars for hunting and for bird watching in my backyard, so I was pleased to find that they were still available.  The price is lower than when I bought my first ones, but they come in a cheaper soft case, and include a less substantial neckstrap than the original one I purchased.

A call to tech support was promptly answered (the only reason there is even one star) and I was informed that my printer was not supported (an HP OfficeJet G85xi)!  Well, normally that might be understandable, but there was no indication on the box, web site or printed quick installation guide that only some printers are supported.  The full 88-page user manual, on the enclosed CD-ROM, has two pages at the back that list supported printers (not many).  To access that same manual from their web site requires that you download it and unzip it.
Even if your printer is supported, be prepared for an involved installation process (the box claims ""Easy Installation"").  Anything that requires manually setting a computer's IP address is not something for a casual user to undertake.  I've programmed computers for years, and installed a few networks at work and home, and it was still a slow installation.

I've tried very hard to like this device, but if you're transferring large data or video files then it doesn't take much to quickly bring this poor thing down to it's knees and it literally takes several hours to transfer files. Whether you're using the Synology File Manager or regular copy through the computer drive folders to move data files, sometimes it just freezes up midstream forcing you to cancel the file transfer and start over again. Even moving large files around within the NAS drive itself is still very slow. Streaming video and moving small files seems to work well but the overall performance has been disappointing..even though everything in my setup is running at 1GBit LAN speed from end to end. Windows setup is a snap, but if you're running Linux then prepare to bang your head against the wall while you try to figure out how to make it all work given the poor Synology software implementation for Linux users...but it does work once you finally get everything installed.

I used this monitor like a work horse, every day for at least 8-12 hours at a time.  It should be noted this monitor didn't die out of the blue, it started to experience problem just after the one year mark.  Sometimes when Id use it, I noticed one side of the screen would flicker when watching videos in fullscreen, but overall I was able to ignore it since I mostly worked in still images.  A few months later I noticed it would leave tracks called Burn-In.  If you work in the computer graphics industry this is a terrible effect to deal with because it would create phantom like streaks on your digital canvas.  Within the last 3 months of its life it would occasionally tell windows it was 4 or 5 monitors not 1, which was annoying but I found a way to work around it.  Anyhow end the end I figure it this way. I only got 2 years out of it, for the not so shallow price of $990 a year. (Because I paid 2 grand for it back then.)

They fit really well and stay in place. The cord between the two pieces can some times annoy, but not like the old style that had a long cord. It can also be helpful as sometimes you must take one ear piece out and you do not have to worry about dropping it.

Sure, it cost 25%-50% more than a comparably equipped Windows machine. But it is definitely worth it. Apps load very quickly, reboots rarely required (and fast if they are).

PROs: Lightning fast startup. I used to wait on my PC. Now my MacBook waits on me.
  Very intuitive, logical interface, even for a newbie.
  Lighted keyboard is wonderful in the evening when surfing the web with the lights down low.

You can't close your Mac, go to another room, then access your drive (unless you have hooked up a keyboard and external monitor). HOWEVER, I was able to find a workaround.

11202353,"I really tried to like this cover, but after much real world use I have come to hate it. It is severely limiting is its usage. It's just too tippy and unstable. Unless you give it a perfectly flat surface it is completely unusable in most situations.

When put into high tent mode, it falls over unless on a perfectly level surface. When put into low tent mode, the cover constantly falls out of the tab meant to hold it in place. I had to put on velcro strips just to keep the cover from falling out. The design makes it nearly impossible to sit back, take it off a table, and relax with it.

The handle, while a nice idea, is situated in a very non-ergonomic position which is almost useless in landscape mode. It should be running closer to vertical, not horizontal.

4095374,"I use headphones to listen to podcasts more than music, and for phone calls on my iphone.  I am not by any means an audio expert, and this review is intended for folks with similar listening habits.
I usually purchase similar products in the $120-$190 price range (Shure), but I was tired of replacing them at such a high cost and thought I would check out some headphones with a mic at a lower price point.  I like that these block out some sound, but not completely, because it can really be unsafe to be in, say, a burning building, and not realize it until you happen to look up and notice flames coming toward you.  That said, if you love sound isolation, I would stick with Shure SE 210 or higher model.  However, for the casual user that needs to hear their kids cry for help when blissfully listening to something while doing chores around the house, this is a good model for you (and ME!)

The mic is a little too high to use to quickly silence the music, but I think it being high likely contributes to better mic sound during phone conversations.  I love that sound adjustment is built into the mic, this is my first set with that feature, and that feature alone is worth the cost of the entire set.

The cord is quite long, and I wish there was a feature to shorten it or quickly tie it out of the way, but I think this is a common characteristic with most headphones.  This set is in a nice neutral color, I am used to just black, so this make it a little easier to find it along other equipment and accessories around my house and in my purse or tote bag.  Comes with a nice pouch, too.  The wire is quite thin with rope-like texture that makes it hard to believe that such great sound is coming from a wire.

I recommend this set for those needing the same purpose, I wear these almost daily, and it makes errands and shopping much easier to have this in an ear in case the phone rings, as I just touch the button on the wire, and voila!  No trying to find my iphone and use a finger to swipe it to answer the phone.",4.0

My wife and I were excited to get the roku so that we could get a netflix account. When the roku arrived, she plugged it in and followed the included instructions, which were simplistic and vague as far as wireless connectivity.
She then spent literally 5 hours trying to get it to hook up to our local network, which it did not seem capable of, despite the fact that it was clearly recognized by the router and the roku hooked up to the wireless network easily. Tech support was unhelpful, ultimately telling her that we need to contact the router manufacturer and that they could not help us set up the device they sold us. There were points in the conversation where it was obvious the tech was typing in canned responses, and even typed ""#tyh"" or something similar (which i take to be shorthand for whatever response he was giving her)...
This is an overpriced electronic paperweight, and has been more of a headache than it was worth. My wife and i will almost certainly be returning it, and will probably purchase a blu-ray dvd player with wireless capabilities instead.

The manufacturer requires them to be used to maintain the warrantee, but I also wanted them as a safety devise in the event of a power surge or electrical storm.  I read the comments about the plug not being tight enough to stop the surge protector from being pulled out when removing something plugged into it, but this didn't concern me because they would be behind the bed with little need to unplug anything very often.  One surge protector holds the bed motor, a lamp, a clock radio, and telephone extension.  The other outlet has the other bed motor, lamp and my husband's CPAP machine.  These protectors have a very large joule rating which was the primary reason I bought them.  However, when the protectors came, the insert says to unplug them in an electrical storm! Isn't that what most people buy them for?  Based on that statement from the manufacturer, I don't know if they protect us from surges due to lightning strikes or not.

3425157,"I've had the Blackrapid straps (2 of them) for a couple years now, purchased from Blackrapid.  First of all this is not a miracle strap.  Under most conditions it works well enough and is better than the usual neck strap.  If you have Manfrotto quick release plates on all your cameras and lenses, the strap attaches quickly and easily--and is more secure than the attachment that comes from Blackrapid.  That little chrome thing is a risk, as it will gradually turn and come unscrewed.  Plus, you only have one, which means if you change lenses or camera body, you have to unscrew the thing and move it.

Important.  When you get the strap, be sure and analyze the threading of the strap through the adjuster, since you get no assembly instructions with the strap.  Better yet, make a diagram and put it away.  If you ever take this thing apart, you'll be glad you did, because the threading is not at all intuitive.  Blackrapid has a video on disassemble/reassemble but it moves quickly, has few closeups, and is of a black strap shot on a black background.  Very hard to see.

In use, it is not nearly as slick as BlackRapid's videos would make you believe.  And in some situations, having the camera slung along your side causes you to bump things with the camera, lens, or flash, putting either the thing you bump or the camera at risk.  Finally, if you use a sling bag, you'll find this strap interferes with it, and there you are with two things that by themselves are time savers, but together, they're a big mess.

It has not recurred in the past week and I hope it goes away forever and not a manifestation of an early failure of the display electronics.,3.0

3730515,"While I haven't used any previous Razer products I'd always heard of them as a high quality component maker and having used this for a bit over a month I have to say I'm decidedly bitter about the thing.

It has two primary problems.

#1: You really can't click the buttons without moving the mouse. Just trying to hold the mouse still while you rapidly left click say will have the cursor jittering back and forth like crazy. I don't know whether it's too light or something in the design but if you're looking for a mouse for say first person shooters this is not a trait you're likely to find desirable and if you're a fan of rts games it's likely to be downright maddening.

#2: The most severe problem - it sometimes just decides to stop working in the middle of use. It won't respond to movement, the buttons stop registering, etc. The only way to get it to work again when it's like this is to either unplug/replug the mouse in at the usb port or to restart your computer. I welcome the reader to try googling ""Razer Imperator"" ""stops working"", it seems to be a fairly widespread problem and one that the latest firmware does not fix. It doesn't happen all that often (Maybe once a week) but if you're paying upward of $60 for a mouse it shouldn't happen at all.

-- Update --

Seriously, do not buy this mouse.

RMA'd the original, got a replacement. Been using it for less than a week and already I can say that not only does the replacement have the same ""randomly stops working until you unplug/replug the mouse"" problem the cursor also has a tendency to wander on its own when the mouse is not even being touched.",1.0

8675595,"Just how big is the 17.3 Inch Laptop Sleeve Well when I read the review I quickly read through where it said it would be a ""Precise fit for laptops and ultrabooks with a 17.3 inch display."" Technically, display is measured diagonally. That means that a 17.3 inch display would have a width of about 15 inches and a height of about 8.5 inches. That was what my monitor had. Imagine my surprise when I saw the size of this thing which actually has external Dimensions of 17.7"" x 1"" x 12.7"" (LxWxH) which means that it can fit a display size of about 20 inches. If you are interested in how I calculated this out to figure out which size sleeve you should get, the approximate display size for most monitors which have a 16:9 aspect ratio (which is most monitors) divide the width by 0.87. How do I know this? Am I some kind of expert? No. I just searched google. Perhaps, had I not been interested in these minutia, I would have noticed the conflicting data before I bought the wrong size sleeve. I contacted Amazon, who made it all right. I can't give it 5 stars because the description led me to buying the wrong size. However, if I was in the market for a really large sleeve, this one seems well built and there are very few others that are out there that can accommodate a 20 inch display. If you are thinking to yourself, that you aren't buying a 20 inch display, so why is this relevant to me? Well I would advise you to ignore the ""display"" that is listed and pay attention to the advertised width and length or estimate the actual display size by calculating it out of from the advertised width and matching that up with your laptop display.

I was looking at the tx-nr838 but after looking at the power supply I realized it was half the size of the 1030s power supply 11 pounds smaller to be exact. I have SVS Ultra towers, Ultra center, Ultra di-pole rears and 4 SVS Prime satellites for Atmos channels plus a PB13 Ultra sub. They are 4 to 6 ohms on average and only 87db so they require some good power to push. This AVR is also 11 channel capable with a two channel amp added. I am using a 2 channel amp for a full 11.2.4 I I would say if you have small speakers and only need 5.1 or 7.1 do the 838 but if you need power for large speakers always look at the avrs weight the 1030 is 45.2 lbs! Avr company's lie about power numbers but the weight tells the truth. Onkyo recently released a firmware update to fix the quiet surround issue with some DTS-MA tracks. It is also 4k ready with hdcp 2.2. I have had this unit for 9 months with no problems. I will be adding more amps soon till I have 11 channels worth of amps. With the tx-nr1030's great o.p.-amps you get full 2.4v on the unballanced pre-outs and 4.4v on the two fully balanced xlr pre-outs. This is important because a lot of AVR's cant drive external amps to full power (most amps need a full 2v for full power) without clipping from the pre-outs this causes the external amps to distort.

There are skips, some songs that it will refuse to play, and doesn't work too well upside down.  Mine had a tendancy to just turn off for no apparent reason, even if it had fresh batteries and the buttons locked.  Oh, and the locker is cheap.  It kept un-locking and then the player would turn on and run the batteries dry.
Not a huge problem and served me well on my trip.  It's now gathering dust and will probably get chucked next time I trip over it.

They are not huge fans but still put out quite a breeze. With the controller in smart mode as the temp raises the fans come on (so they are not running constantly) and then their speed changes as the temp changes - very cool - pun intended. Here is the reason for the 2 stars instead of the 5 stars... After having them in place for over 2 months they started making clicking noises. It started with one and then the other followed. The function is not harmed and I have tried numerous placement positions but the noise continues... it even seems to be increasing with time.

10758045,"Awesome keyboard/mouse combo. I've owned a couple of Performance Mouse MX for quite a few years, so I knew I'd love the mouse. The keyboard is really great too. One nice feature of both is that the batteries are rechargeable, and the batteries last a long time. But even if you're a power user, don't worry. They can both be used while charging from your computer USB ports. I'm not gaming or anything like that, but for normal use, I love these things. The mouse is comfortable in the hand, and has some (but not too many) extra feature buttons that I miss terribly when I'm at a computer without MY mouse. The wheel is easily changeable from free-wheeling to clicky. The page-back and page forward buttons are placed just right, and all the buttons are customizable if you have a favorite function you want to access from the mouse. The keyboard has a nice feel to it. The battery, as I said, lasts quite a while, and can be charged while using the keyboard anyway. If you want the battery in the keyboard to last even longer, you can turn the back light down or off. There are 3 levels of brightness plus off.

In use it's great! I stand for most of the day, but when I want to work from the desk I just swing it down.

6091830,"I've had the Viper remote start for several years and the range of the remote is great, but there were times when in a large office buildings, airports, or when parked in a structure several blocks that the key fob transmitter wasn't powerful enough to reach the car.

Easy plug and play installation with existing Viper 5301 system.  Power and ground to the unit and plug in to existing 5301 system using the supplied cable.  I was puzzled when the SmartStart didn't respond initially, but learned that only those licensed by Viper are allowed to initialize internet connection to the unit.  (This is probably a good thing for security/safety)  A quick call to the seller to provide my mobile number and serial number, and they initialized the unit remotely within 10 minutes!

I've been using it for over a month now with my WindowsPhone and it and it has performed flawlessly!  The WindowsPhone app could use some additional bells and whistles to match other SmartStart apps, but the basics - Start and stop engine, lock and unlock doors, trunk opener, car location and scheduled starts - all work flawlessly.

14478247,"This little Sansa clip + is the coolest MP3 player I have ever seen. Controls are a breeze and work just like they are supposed to. There is no need for extra software or joining up with any music clubs, although optional if you wish. Plug into your computer and just drag music files, nothing could be easier! The Slot radio is just plain ingenious, with 1000 songs! The choice of music loaded onto the micro flash card is fantastic, not all the played out songs that you will hear on regular radio stations, but a fantastic selection of many varied artists. The price is a giveaway, I still can't get over it. Only negative that I can see is in the FM radio that is built in. The reception fades sometimes in my area, but I will not hold that against it because all the other things that are good about this far outway that. It has a built in equalizer that also has a custom setting, and with my expensive, aftermarket headphones the sound is close to audiofile. Bass, clear highs, stereo seperation, all better than I have seen with my other, which shall remane nameless, expensive player. I recommend this highly, especially to those frustrated with those players that freeze up and take hours to set up and have to scroll through many menu items to get where you want to go. Oh, one last thing, it has a clip, hence Sansa Clip, that is mounted permanantly to the back and it works GREAT! No more stopping to pick up your player that has fallen out of your pocket and bounced off the pavement. Clip it to your shirt, your pocket, anywhere convenient, it is super light and stays where you put it and leaves the volume control and skip or back control right where you can get to them while working out, riding your bicycle, or whatever. Thank you, Sansa Clip+ ! !",5.0

Things you should know:
If you're gaming at 1080p, going to 1440p yields a pretty drastic improvement. To make use of 1440p at up to 144Hz takes quite a bit of GPU power though, depending on the game you're playing. I'm running two overclocked GTX680's(4GB VRAM each, because SLI looks at VRAM in parallel rather than series). Furthermore, I would not attempt 1440p with less than 4GB of VRAM(maybe 3GB, but not 2GB, you will see diminished returns). Note: one of my GTX680s is fairly comparable to a GTX970, with exception that Nvidia appears to enjoy releasing drivers that mess with older hardware(at least as far as Battlefield 4 is concerned).

7228683,"This product is recommended to those that use their iPad Mini quite a lot. I do own an iPad Mini 2nd generation with retina display and this product have prevented many accidental falls, however, it does not protect your product 100%, especially not from water.

If you are a cautious individual who is careful with their products, and love an executive looking, multipurpose, protective case, then this product is for you.

The downside is that the leather does not last for a long time. I've used this product consistently and in 4 months, there are tears on the edges of the leather cover, and since it's black, it's not too visible from afar. But then again, I have used this product constantly (daily). Also, when you insert your iPad Mini, it would not centered correctly, although all the buttons, charger port, and the cameras are accessible. When you do place numerous cards in the card inserts as well as small notes in the internal pocket, the magnet on the edges of the flap that causes the iPad Mini to go to sleep hinders that function. You sometimes have to adjust it to cause the magnets to touch. The pen/stylus holder is a downside. I wished it was rubbery so it can grip my stylus and prevents it from sliding and falling off of the case.

This may help, but I use this product in Colorado climate, which has a bipolar weather that changes quite a lot from sunny, to a freezing temperature. I use this case when I'm teaching at church, working at the hotel, when I go to church, or even when I'm in my free time. I've used my product even for PowerPoint presentation and many other without taking the iPad off of the cover.

-Price. These sound as good as any speaker set up to $300, Once you start hitting 300-500$ you'll start to get into some nicer -speaker sets.

Cons:
-I don't like the plastic casing around the speaker. It doesn't hurt the sound at all and it actually looks pretty nice. I would just prefer for it to be wood. Wood makes it more durable and makes then a little heavier which for some reason i like better.

Read many, many, many reviews and eventually decide it on this one because it had all the features that I actually would use. My favorite is the location of food. Did not opt for the Traffic roadmate because I do not l live in a big city and read all the problems with commericial banners/advertisment interfeering with directions. Luv the direction chimes and not all th constant voice updates. You can miss a turn and don't have to be totally rerouted with a u-turn or some crazy turnaround, the system will give you a route in the way that you're currently heading. Only small con is sometimes it does not recoginize my house but I think that just a satellite problem or because I didn't update the maps. Oh well no need anyway because I know my way home and how to use common sense to lead me out to my final destination. Screen is clear/crisp, sound is good and lane assist is awesome with not only the visual but the voice prompt; it lets you know well ahead about lane changes and/or exits.....Nice!  Cant say anything about the customer service or map upgrades as we have not utilize any of those just yet. Overall very satisified with the price, features, and function of this product.

I haven't used them in inclement weather, nor am i likely to, but it's nice to know they are built to handle the elements.

I got the drivers online using a computer with internet access (other reviews contain the site for drivers), then I copied it onto a usb flash drive, put the drivers onto my old desktop mac, installed them, and the wifi adapter worked like magic.
It picks up my home wifi just as fast as any other computer I own, regardless of whether they have built-in wifi or require an adapter.

13610312,"PRO:  built like a tank. Much more accurate than the Apple keyboard for rapid typists.  Special characters right on the keys with easy access (no having to pull open another drop down menu or refer to a list of special characters).  Great tactile response while typing, hence the name.  Three full USB ports, REALLY handy for iMac users who must otherwise reach around the back of the machine to install a thumb drive.

CON:  Awfully goddamned loud.  You loose some functionality from the ""F"" keys.  Not as cool looking as the Apple keyboard, printing the aforementioned special characters on the keys themselves makes for an overall cluttered appearance.

Bottom line, if you do a lot of typing and you find you are all over the Apple supplied keyboard, the Tactile Pro is a worthwhile investment.",3.0
2748231,"This was a very well thought out product and I purchased it because of the many functions and versatility. I only gave it 3 stars because the customer support is worse than none! I had problems with the fact that the only app that you could purchase would not install. I emailed the company for suggestions/instructions and never got a reply. I then called and was on hold for 27 minutes listening to 'how important your call is to us' but no one answered the call.  I could not install flash which meant that with the wireless internet connection viewing music videos on line was difficult if not impossible. I was able to upload my music videos to it from my computer by converting the files, and the picture quality is great as is the viewing screen. The sound comes from only one side of the unit so the speaker gives poor quality sound. Using stereo headsets the sound is fine but I would have preferred speakers from both sides of the unit. Every function requires another product purchase accessory to use them which makes the unit cost close to the same amount to do all functions as the unit itself costs.

It's still a fun product to own, as long as you don't expect to do everything it claims to do. Having owned it now since last Christmas, I am enjoying the web radio instead of trying to view videos on line and watching my music videos or listening to mp3's. With 250 GB there is lots of storage space - enough to upload movies to watch too. If they were a user-friendly company with a decent customer support and sold apps for it (more than the one they have) this could have been the smaller version of the ipad before Apple invented it.",3.0

A nice touch is that small magnets are sewn into the top of the side pleats which keep the pleats neatly folded, but easily release to allow the bag to expand for larger loads.  The soft, textured leather flap has two snap closure positions, one for normal use, and another mounted farther up so, again, if you need to expand the bag the flap can still be snapped closed.

This is a very well made product, the felted wool balls are about an inch to an inch and a half large. The colors are vibrant and very easy on the eyes so they arnt vibrant enough to blind you but vibrant enough to know that it is green, red, and white. The balls really are constructed well, made of the most quality felted wool that I have come across so far.
The only thing that I didn't like is that it is wrapped around a piece of cardboard or plastic when you receive it and in the process of taking it off of the piece of cardboard I accidentally broke one of the thin threads that hold all the balls together I was a little upset over this. I feel tha there has to be a better way for it to be untangled when you receive the product.
So in my opinion I just feel the thread that holds all the balls in the garland position should be thicker so that way they do not break that easily. Everything else about this product is great, I mean the felted balls are very well done it is all put together evenly all have the same distance in between the felted balls so it isn't lopsided was just hoping for a stronger string. When you hang them up they are super cute and I will purchase more of these for my christmas tree and just be a little more gentle when I unwrap them!

I used it to back up video some data using a MacBook Pro.
since all I'm working with is a Mac environment I formated the drive as soon as I got it and things looked fine beside it taking it's time to mount.
But then the drive would just randomly disconnect - and I seriously mean randomly there was nothing that could've triggered it. It happened while in standby as well as during transfers which is very frustrating.
Talking about standby when the drive is not in use it goes to 'sleep' and takes it time to wake back up (more frustration)
I ordered a new drive but was told to continue with the backup anyways
So I come back the next day and the drive would just not show up in my finder and there was no sign of it connecting to my MBP.
Neither disk utilities nor any other HD managing program would recognize it.
I repeat the connecting process a couple times and just when I was about to let it be it mounts ....
after doing the same procedure exactly the same.

The only thing I'll ding it for is an on/off switch that is really hard to reach and operate.  If I'm not going to be filming for a while I turn it off and then I seem to have bad luck at remembering to turn it on.  For me, I shoot photographs and videos of trains, both model trains and full-size, and often I only get one chance to record the subject doing whatever it is doing so I can't go back and reshoot.

If the batteries were easier to replace I'd tempt fate and just leave the thing on the whole day, knowing I could swap out batteries if the need should arise, but I found opening the battery compartment to be difficult as well so I am trying to avoid doing that operation.

Overall, the audio quality is fine for the price and the other issues wouldn't keep me from buying it at a low price, but if I shot more frequently I would find the annoyances to be much larger and I would expect to pay more to receive the higher quality befitting a more professional setup.

In this case its not the depth of the basket, its the diameter.  The air volume is a bit lower than recommended for these subs, but I added as much polyfill as I could and they sound great.  You definitely lose some volume on the low-end notes, but that's what you get for cramming 12's into a tiny box.

Good luck disabling that terribly thought out function. It's a static setting with no off switch. So if these were only to blast loud music, maybe still look at another, more reliable set of speakers because that's just a smarter buy than wasting $60.

They also attempt to do you a solid and filter background sound like wind or static, which I guess someone might enjoy. But for tv shows, is entirely ill conceived idea.

First one, bluetooth connection was terrible. Second one, better connection -- but poor sound. Third, decent connection and sound -- but really, really poor ergonomics.

Finally, I sprang for the brand name. In the past, with single-ear business headsets, Plantronics was the only one that maintained a solid connection and was comfortable to wear. So I figured at least the durn thing would stay connected. And.. it does. And... the sound is pretty good!

This is a nifty dash cam size wise. The problem is that there are way too many buttons and the battery won't last for more than 2-3 minutes. The battery only serves as a backup to help the cam finish saving the files after the car is turned off. That said, even to review a few minutes of footage, you will need to be tethered to the power source. The interface is clunky and hard to use. I struggled along for 5-10 minutes just to set the date. Eventually i found the option. The manual is not great, it details what each button does not get into specific menu options.

The day time operation was good. Camcorder turned on upon ignition, recorded in 10 minute loops. All was good till, I enabled nightmode. The cam would not record more than 10seconds. It would stop after 10s. I was constantly trying to get it to start recording and it would stop after 7 s of recording. This is only with nightmode. Eventually, I returned the product.

My keyboard is paired with my Surface Pro 3 (what I'm currently using right now), Galaxy Note 4 (Android) and iPad mini (Apple iOS). My Surface Pro 3 cover/keyboard broke a couple of days ago and despite not having any issues relying solely on the pen (handwriting recognition is good on the Surface Pro 3/Windows 10) the virtual keyboard ""steals"" too much real estate.

The battery last for ages (60 days) on a single 90 minute charge. It's very easy to pair with devices and the ""platform"" switch supports up to 3 paired devices. Despite the keyboard being smaller than the Surface Pro 3 cover/keyboard it's way more comfortable to use with less typing errors, despite my fat fingers. I've remapped the right-hand shift to the Insert key as I use it for my mind-map software. The detachable stand is useful for tablets and phones or as a more ergonomic keyboard angle. An additional benefit is the fact that my posture is much more ergonomic than when I had the Surface Pro 3 cover/keyboard.

The only caveat is that I've yet to find a comprehensive manual for the keyboard mapping (key combinations) though through trial and error I've managed to figure out most useful/common keyboard combinations. It might be in the manual I lost...

20025393,"This is my 2nd product from Moshi. I really like these screen protectors because they are very different than any others I've tried.

The first time around I only found the anti-glare version so that's what I ordered. I'm not a big fan of matte screen covers in general but I liked the other aspects of this that I got over the matte view. Great things include: how nicely it fits, how easy it is to install, the fact that it is removable/washable/reusable & that there are never any bubbles due to dust/pet hair etc.

Unfortunately I dropped my iPad Air 2 and the protector got a couple annoying scratches, so I went back to order another one & found this clear version. Each version (matte & shiny) have their own pros/cons & I'm not completely sure which one I like better.

The anti-glare version does change the look of the retina screen slightly. I felt like it kept the colors from being as bright as they should be with the retina display. But the anti-glare is REALLY nice...probably worth the slight impact on the brightness.

I love this shiny one because the retina screen looks amazing (you can't tell there's a screen protector at all)...but there is a lot of glare (which is to be expected). Strangely there is a visible dot pattern in the protector that you can see when light is shining on the screen (basically small dots in a grid throughout the entire screen - dots are maybe 3/16"" apart)...not crazy about that but it's not visible all the time & despite the dots, the screen clarity is remarkable.

All-in-all they are both the best protectors I've ever used. Both protectors are flexible, durable & very easy to install. The touch feeling of the screen is unchanged with these protectors. I highly recommend either one...especially if you find that you can NEVER install a screen protector without hair/dust causing bubbles.",5.0

I was pleasantly surprised, after playing around with it, how it actually works perfectly. I have a Fuji X-M1 and used the 16-50mm kit lens for my testing.

This set of extension tubes is actually comprise of 5 pieces, 1 camera mount (attaches to your camera), 1 lens mount (attaches to your lens), 1 each of the following tubes - 7mm, 14mm, & 28mm (which screws in between the camera mount and lens mount. You can also not use the tubes and just screw the lens mount into the camera mount.

The issue that worried me the most was the lens getting stuck in the lens mount. Fortunately, this did not happen to me. The lens mounted snugly with the lens mount and clicked into place after rotating clockwise. To remove, I simply pull the lens release knob back on the lens mount and twist the lens counter-clockwise. This also addresses the issue of the lens not mounting properly.

This set of tubes do not have the correct electrical contacts so I set my camera to manual focus and set the Shoot Without Lens to ON. With the extension tubes mounted, you cannot set the aperture and the focus ring does not work (and by extension, Auto-Focus will not work either). You can focus by moving the camera back and forth coupled with changing the focal length of the lens by zooming in and out.

You can also adjust the exposure by changing the shutter speed and/or the ISO setting. I posted some pictures and hope this review will be helpful.",5.0

4989601,"I've been using this case for about a month. It protects my iPad well, but I was disappointed with a few things about it.
Cons-
The color was way duller than advertised and expected. It's still purple, just a lot darker.
It's kind of hard to reach the volume and silence switch. You have to put your finger between the iPad and the case a little bit, but it's still able to be used.
The strap used to hold in the iPad can loosen a little bit, but the iPad will never fall out. It's just annoying.
The bottom right corner of the iPad sticks out sometimes. Once again annoying.

Pros-
This case does a great job of protecting my iPad from bumps, scratches, and drops. I even let my young cousins use my iPad. I trust the case.
It has the magnet sleep/wake function.
You can fold back the front of the case to type or watch movies.
The leather feels good, but I'm unsure if it's 100% real leather.
The camera, speaker, and earphone cut outs are placed accurately.
It's compatible with screen protectors.
It's really easy to get the iPad in and out of the case. Great for people who like to use the iPad with out a case sometimes. I can easily access the cleaning cloth I hide in the back.

I gave it four stars because the case is good for what I paid for it to do, but had I known about these cons, I probably would not have purchased the case.",4.0

4132943,"From installing the motherboard, to navigating a built pc, this case is a true joy to work with. Major awesome features:

1) Power supply slide out tray -- This made adding a power supply a ton easier and faster. And when the unit needs to be upgraded, it will be a snap.

2) Thumbscrews on everything -- Need to get access to a section in the case fast, this design makes it possible. Almost every screw that you will access can be manipulated with just your hands.

3) Lots of fans -- 15 possible 120mm fans!!! Whoa, this is some very serious cooling. The case comes with 5, and they are the two speed 120mm variety from Antec.

4) Straight path to the motherboard -- With this case you have direct, full access to the motherboard. No lips, sharp edges, or overhangs. The motherboard tray is removable but I doubt anyone will need it. Makes installing, or working with the components a snap.

5) Motherboard tray -- It has a hole in it! The spot where your proc will be mounted, there is a hole so that the dans will be able to cool the underside of your processor mount.

Bummer points:

a) Toolbox needs a real screwdriver to access it -- It fits snug, but when at a lan party, if not screwed in, you might loose it. These should be thumb screwed on.

Anyways....these are not that slim. Right when I put it on, I can feel the added bulkiness all around. You can clearly see a lining of clear silicon encompassing the iPad when you look at it head on. If your goal is to get the thinnest looking bezel and depth (but still want protection of course), I would try something else. My guess is, if you're on this page looking at this product, you got your eyes set on something a little more discreet so these ain't it.

17534368,"Fits my 2015 MacBook Air perfectly. Slides right in and out with ease, while being just snug enough that it doesn't wiggle around inside the sleeve. The cutout for the charging chord is also just deep enough that I can keep my plug-and-play Bluetooth mouse dongle in the USB slot.

The quality of the material is good. The combination of the felt with the leather looks professional without being cumbersome. The inside lining is nice and soft and smooth, and the magnets have just the right amount of strength. Since the sleeve isn't bulky, I can slip it right into my bag to run out to a client meeting, without snagging or taking up too much room.

The extra pocket on the outside is best for loose papers or perhaps a slim notepad. If you're considering this model because it's slim, putting anything bulky in the pocket sort of defeats the purpose.

The ear piece fits nicely around my ears and so far have not lead to any ear fatigue.( I do have smaller sized ears.) The cord is wonderful, being flat and covered in a rubbery plastic to keep it from getting tangled. It also can be unplugged from the headset itself, a handy feature if you need to replace the cord itself. (it appears to be a standard/universal size)

Now the sound I have been really enjoying. I am not an audiophile by any means but these have been impressive. It makes you feel like you are in a room with music washing over you. The sound is clear and crisp with the deep tones having a nice richness to them and the higher notes having clarity. They don't seem to have much sound leakage but they also aren't sound proof.

I have very small ears and it took me like 3 days to try to find the right fit, they kept falling off everytime i went out running or did any routine that required me to move around a lot. I even had to try them on without any earbuds at one point, and try different sizes on different ears. Finally i settled for the bi-flange ear buds (smaller than the smallest earbuds) and the small ear stabilizers, and even with that I wish they had a slightly smaller size, cause after wearing them for a few hours my ear canal starts to feel umcomfortable.

Tonight I accidentally plugged  my Roku into my tablet plug. It arced sparks and smelled horrendous, and is totally fried. I've had it two weeks and now it is fried. Roku says you can move it from room to room, but that's what caused my mistake. I recommend extreme care when using  that option.

The real problem is, if you aren't into Netflix, it saves you no money. I couldn't replace a single cable box. The hundreds of channels they advertise include ""Drive-In Classics-Horror"". Reading the other reviews I thought ( I might not have been paying attention) those channels correlated to real tv channels, not special interest channels.

Cons:

Power switch and ports - They are located on the back of the machine in an inconvenient location. In my personal opinion If they were placed on one side or the other would make using this product just that much easier.
The lights - They are very bright at night. Be wary of sleeping roommates.
The rubber feet - The glue used to hold them on are very weak and the pads can easily be lost.

I should say that the overall image and movie quality out of this camcorder is rich and vivid. The controls are easy and self-intuitive, placed right where you'd expect it to be, and the on-screen controls I thought are pretty neat considering I have mid-sized fingers. Like several other reviews mention, the battery does tend to protrude out a little but I don't mind it given the overall performance of the camcorder. Transferring and burning is straightforward although I wish that the camcorder software had more in depth editing/effect making capabilities. The charging base will need to go everywhere you go (especially on long trips) but I didn't mind it one bit since it was light and does not add to your luggage at all. Video can be recorded in 3 different and distinct formats, given that this is a CMOS recording, the effect on overall image blending is negligible. The camcorder is light, battery life is just about what is the norm and the storage is way more enough than I'd ever need ( I regularly tend to transfer data out to a DVD/Computer closeby).

We were in the market for a new flat-screen TV and went home with this 55-inch unit that works very well in our family room.  From in the box to working on our cable system in under 10 minutes with no tweaking required, we were impressed.  The other part of the deal was the price, over 50% the sticker price and prices listed here.  For our needs this has been a wonderful purchase.

The unit sits on two legs at either end of the unit and sits fairly low, so if you've had a soundbar under your old unit it probably will not work in that fashion with this Sharp TV.  Thus far we have not missed our soundbar, so not sure we will work to remount it somewhere else or replace it.

1. Digital output. The on-board digital-analog conversion is OK, and no where near as good as that found in most decent receivers or preamps. (Someone at Sangean told me this will be featured in the next tuner - due out around September, 2007). Also, the analog output seems ""hot"". A local classical station's (KUSC) HD feed breaks up at higher frequencies, and my speculation is that the output is overdriving the inputs to my Rotel preamp.

2. Preset scan. Geez, they've got so many other scan modes, but they missed this one!

3. Direct preset access - instead of having to press ""preset"" followed by a number (where a preset station is located).

4. A display dimmer! I know someone else already mentioned this... Man that thing is bright! Good news is that the display is very informative, and cool in blue. Note that turning down the contrast does help a bit.

5. Discrete ON and OFF commands. This is helpful if you use a learning remote control that uses macro-sequences. A toggling power button, as included on the HDT-1, is less than ideal.

Not sure why, but that was very disappointing when I spent a week in a room with a digital phone in at and was stuck using a regular phone line, plugged into the wall, to access my dial up account.).

The Dell turn wheel rotates a bit rougher than the Basics model, but does have slight finger indentations but I cannot notice if it's more comfortable than the Basics.  It started instantly (as did the Amazon Basics mouse) with nothing done other than put the battery in the mouse, insert the antennae in the USB port and turn the mouse on.

The only thing that I really didn't like too much was the shrink wrap plastic nuclear proof packaging.  It was quite a struggle to finally free the mouse and it's antennae.  Basics are much easier to open and I don't recall any plastic packaging.",4.0
4408934,"I read a lot of reviews about different switches and there were a lot of complaints about random switching and other problems.  This one was rated well, and it has absolutely proven to be worth the extra few bucks.  We hardly think about it - just turn something on, and it automatically switches to that item.  Turn it off, and it switches back to what's left on.

I do have a cable box that sends a signal even when turned off, so it sometimes goes to cable when I turn an item off but intended to use something other than cable.  But you can't ask a piece of electronic equipment to read your mind - just press the button on the front, or on the remote, and it easily switches.

12706596,"Unfortunately I didn't read all of the reviews about this device.  There are several 2 star ratings that complain about noise. I wanted to be able to use a single set of speakers with two different computers. After I installed the device, I immediately noticed noise coming from the speakers. It seems to work fine with only one computer plugged in.  But, when you plug in a second (or third) computer you can hear an audible hum.  Others have described it as a buzz or static. I'd guess it's inadequate shielding inside the device resulting from its low cost. I did some basic troubleshooting by swapping out cables to rule out cabling as a source of the problem.  Unfortunately, the problem seems to be with the device itself. The speakers have no audible noise when plugged directly into each of my 2 computers.

I would have marked it 1 star but for the fact that it does perform its switching function properly. I would not recommend this to someone else.",2.0
9627277,"This product is great. There are so many combinations you can use to setup the stand in different ways since the arms have a full range of settings on each arm.  I can use it as somewhat of a mini laptop table when sitting on a couch, have it propped up on the desk (while I'm sitting or standing) in so many ways, or just lay it flat on the desk or for storing it while not in use.

The only thing I wish they could improve is the weight bearing.  Don't get me wrong, the stand is strong, especially when used properly. I just noticed that I'm extra careful when my laptop is on the platform.  It feels like any moderate to substantial bump to the side of it could just tip the whole thing over--at least when the two arms closest to the platform are straight up and down, and the lowest arm is flush against a flat surface. Also, the product base (bottom arm) seems to glide too easily on a large, clean, wooden desk. Perhaps they could add rubber bumpers on the bottom or some mechanism to prevent that.  It makes me nervous to see my $3,000 computer slide in any circumstance and to any degree.",5.0
17885735,"This is a fine television and considering the price (I've had this two weeks and Crutchfield dropped the price $50) and size.  However there are a couple of quirks I don't like.  One is the remote and the start up time when you turn it on.  After the picture appears the remote still doesn't function for a few more seconds.  The on screen menus look slick but in reality offer very little adjustment.  Finally the shiny band at the bottom of the screen houses the speakers and when viewed from an angle is very ripply.  Not very attractive if you have a lot of natural light in your room.

1175853,"I have been buying Japanese brands all my life in believing that Japanese electronics product is simply the best in terms of quality and reliability for general consumers.  But I have been hearing really good things about Samsung's line of TV and the contrast ratio of 3000:1 on this TV made me pull the trigger.

I am just very disappointed because the complaint about the ""Not supported mode"" is very true.  It appears that this TV doesn't like to support progressive scan from a progressive scan DVD player.  It does fine with HDTV signals which are currently at 720p or 1080i but half of my use of this TV is to watch DVDs on a progressive scan dvd player.  Yes, I can still watch DVDs by disabling the progressive mode of the DVD and watching it in 480i.  But that's like going backwards 5 years.
And the thing about Xbox 360 makes perfect sense.  If you are playing games on it, you are most likely in HD mode so it works, but if you are trying to watch a DVD, then you are in progressive scan mode (480p) so it doesn't work.  I am just deeply disappointed in Samsung that they failed me like this on my very first Samsung purchase.  This is a basic mode that they overlooked.  Who knows what might go wrong next?  This TV is going back to the store.
The TV itself is very nice actually.  Nice sleek look, great picture from HD signals, but it still left a really bad taste in my mouth that Samsung couldn't get one of the most basic things right.

An update.  If I could rate Samsung's Tech support, I would give it 0 stars.  I called them up on this issue and was hung up on twice while in the process of going to higher level of support (which I am beginning to guess is their way of hanging up on people).",2.0

So I sent it back and forgot about it.  Then almost A YEAR LATER I finally got around to writing a review for it and since my first experience was bad I wrote a bad review.  After a few days I got an email asking me what had gone wrong and if they could send me a new one (tested) for free.  At first I did not thing it would be worth the trouble but after a second email from them I said I would.

I made my purchase on 7/29/11 and started using them right after I purchased them making sure that I charged them properly first.  I have intended to wait to charge them again after they had died the first time. As of this writing (08/31/11)they have still not lost their charge. I do probably use them about 8-10 hours per week depending on how much I am sitting at my computer doing paperwork.

Nice mounting option included which also is to reference the black piece attached to the cord.

I think I might use this outside on occasion because I like that ports are not blocked even with larger adapters attached. Obviously it won't be left out, just taken and used then brought back in which means it won't see frequent use but seems up to the task as this point.

This grey version is a MUCH tighter fit for the M2 card, so tight I worry about breaking the M2 card getting it in and out. If you want to use this as a pen drive, no problem, but if you want to use it as a reader for an M2 card you use in another device and you want to insert and remove the memory card frequently, that's a major negative.

A 5400 RPM hard drive is completely inadequate for a modern Windows 8 system. Doesn't even make sense given the price for 7200rpm drives is almost the same. Better yet, a 512gb SSD is only about $150 more. Lenovo needs to get on the ball. Out of the box this desktop is way too slow to boot. And this is their updated model for fall 2014! Very disappointing!

Thankfully, I grabbed a Crucial MX100 SSD on Amazon, cloned the hard drive, and replaced it in about 2 hours. The screen pry's apart from the body which is a hair raising experience to do on a new PC. Thankfully, Lenovo has videos online for how to do this at (http://www.lenovoservicetraining.com/). Needless to say, be very careful if you choose to do this.

Overall, it's a very nice device. My wife prefers the dull fingerprint proof screen, although I think it does look a little fuzzy (not as bright). That's a matter of choice. The Aura interface is very cool although we haven't used it that much yet. I prefer the 1080 HD resolution over QHD -- it's plenty sharp and battery life will be much better.

It is so easy to take this unit with me anywhere and play games or surf the web.  I have not yet used the Polaris Office suite for documents, but the rest of the software is solid.  Features I am particularly happy with are the GPS and Google Maps--they make trip planning easy while on the road with the bigger-than-a-gps-unit screen and wi-fi capability.  It doesn't replace my GPS unit but allows another option while traveling.  I just wish the GPS was faster to load the current location.  We do live in Germany, so maybe the satellite signals aren't as strong(?).

We have not been able to test the media streaming since Germany's draconian laws regarding sharing of media prevent us from Hulu, Netflix and the like.  The mini HDMI port works great, though, and is an unexpected extra that will likely make many folks happy.

The available keyboard adds a TON of battery life, two USB ports, and additional SD card slot (not micro) and a clamshell form that makes your new Eee Pad easy to carry around without a case.  It does weigh a bit more with the keyboard but it is still not as heavy as our HP Mini netbook while being much better looking and easier to use.  Can you live wthout the keyboard?  You may never miss it but for me it has been quite worthwhile.  Best thing is I can leave the keyboard at home when I want easier portability.  Try that with a netbook.  Best yet, you can get several light days/evenings of use off of each charge when the keyboard is attached.

Best of all, I get all the basic functions I need with a robust software market that is free from Microsoft and Apple rhetoric and associated cost bloating.

Well before the main reason I got it stopped working I liked how it could handle pretty much any type of video format I put on it. I had some random trailers I downloaded in FLV format that didn't work but that was it.

Accessing your videos was a bit of a mess though. If you have nothing but rips of your DVD/Blu-Ray movie collection on it and each file is labeled correctly it's pretty easy to navigate. Once you add things like individual TV episodes things get a bit messy.

The interface is SLOW. Sometimes you think you didn't press a button because nothing happened. You press again and it shoots past what you were going to.

Official firmware? Want to go up or down? Press left and right... the Semi-official is a bit better.

Oh, those fancy screen shots showing movie posters and stuff? All done by you using third party programs if you want them.

I used it 4 times in different locations and did not have a single issue with it the entire time. I did follow the instructions to soak it in clean water afterward and clean the seals, and having done that it has been a terrific camera. We have one also at my work along with a rugged Olympus Stylus Tough point and shoot and the Panasonic has performed much better. The Olympus was taken underwater one time and leaked into the board so it had to be replaced (although I will say their service was great, but I cannot speak about Panasonic service yet since I haven't needed it!). The only downfall I would say it has is that it sometimes does not take the clearest photos in low light, but since this seems to be a common problem with all point and shoots I've used I don't believe it is a drawback to buying it. It takes excellent, clear photos, especially outdoors and also does very well in video mode. The GPS feature is also nice since it will tell you the name of the location you are closest to and saves that information. It also has several different settings depending on the environment you are shooting in.

13762943,"I don't right many reviews but I felt one was due for this item. I bought this in March 2015 with the main purpose of listening to Podcasts in my car. The majority of this speaker's life was spent sitting in my cup holder. I took it outdoors camping less than 5 times. It worked just-ok for those purposes. While driving at high speeds on the highway, the outside noise became too loud and drowned out most podcasts. If it rained heavily, forget it. Then in July 2015 it suddenly stopped working. It would power up and my phone could connect via blue tooth but no sound would come out. I unscrewed the back to see if I could tell what the issue was and the speaker cables became unattached. It looked like they were barely attached to begin with - just a tiny single coil of wire was soldered to the speaker. It would be possible - if I had a soldering iron, a magnifying glass and the proper tools - to reattach them. But, I'm not about to run out and by several tools to fix a $35 speaker.

Normally, a good company would stand by there product and I would email the manufacturer directly. However, there is no contact info anywhere on the web for Omaker. Even Amazon support could not find the info. Luckily, Amazon was nice enough to allow me a return (at 80% of my purchase price) even though the refund time had long passed.

It's possible that I received a lemon and others are more durable but I would not recommend this device. Buyer beware.

UPDATE

So, even though Amazon gave me a partial refund past their usual timeframe Omaker did contact me. The support rep offered to send me a free one as a make good. So turns out the manufacturer does have a support team. I hope they include the contact info somewhere easily accessible from now on.

First, it has one of the brightest screens I've seen on recent Garmin units - it's not washed out by sunlight and it's sharp and easy to read. Secondly, the speaker is far better than some earlier models, so you can hear the ""nav lady"" perfectly at highway speeds. Routing is almost immediate after you enter a destination, and the directions are clear and concise. The maps are about the most up-to-date you can get these days, and Navteq is among the best in that category. The unit doesn't have to be placed up high on the window or dash - it gets the sat signals well even if it's mounted down on the dash out of the sun.

Only downside is that signal acquisition first thing in the morning when the unit is cold is kind of slow, but after it warms up, it is ready to navigate as soon as it gets power. And it doesn't announce turns by street name - big deal. Otherwise all is good - lots of POI's, great maps, good directions.

When everything went MP3 I tried a few other models and went back to the Sony and bought the 2 Gig version of the NW-203F and it lasted for about FOUR years. I use it in the gym, Aqua Jog (and constantly get wet), Sweat, dropped weights on it (accidentally), Walked outside in the Fog and the Drizzle and have even stepped on it a few times. I defy any of those fancier MP3 players that have more storage, and touchscreens to be that durable. With some others you have to spend extra's for accessories to take it near the water.  My Arms are too big for the arm band, so I stick it in  my headband. I don't use the ear pieces that come with it, I buy the old fashioned durable Sports Walkman headphones that have been around for decades (the wires will go out before the earpieces do).

Storage wise 2 Gigs was plenty and 1 Gig is adequate.

OK what's wrong with it?  Rarely can get the fast forward or rewind to work. The Software IS horrible. There is no criteria for which format it will recognize and which one it won't, and its inconsistent. In other words sometimes it will play a song and sometimes it won't. It seems to vary each time you reload from the library (It's also been known to stick it in an ""unrecognizable"" folder).

Battery is OK, if you are in a pinch (you forgot to charge it and you need to run soon) A few minutes in the computer will give you a few hours. A full charge much more. You need to use the special USB connector for the software to see it, otherwise all you can do is charge it!

3223169,"I'll be honest and say I absolutely hated this TV when I first got it.  Thought broadcast television and gaming was just awful--to the point that I had scheduled a return.  I came from an lcd so I might have been biased against plasmas.  But I decided to do some research and tweaked the picture, and also I think it takes a couple of days for the plasma colors to set or whatever the technical jargon is.  Whatever it was, I couldn't be happier about the purchase now that I retracted the cancellation.  Now, the picture/color/clarity is perfect (for a $[...] set anyway), but especially when the room is dark or darker.  So if you are on the fence, I say take a look at your neighborhood store and give it a try if you like it there.  Just give the tv about a week to set and go to [...] and search to see what settings are best for the TV.",5.0
4293942,"From the moment I opened the package and first held this speaker in my hand, I KNEW that this was a piece of high-quality engineering.  I pulled the headphone plug (with its 3"" cord) from its housing, built-into the bottom of the casing, and plugged it into my phone/mp3 player.  Turned it on by holding the button in for a few seconds until the LED came on and my ears were treated to a wonderful treat from this marvelous machine.
  Pros:
1- Quality construction.
2- Loud for its size.
3- Can hold hundreds of songs.
4- Precise reproduction of the music- Just the way it was created.
5- You can hook it up to another one and listen in stereo!

  Cons:
1- Short cord.
2- Doesn't fit in jacket pocket well, since it's round.
3- You can't fast-forward to the next song quickly. You'll have to skip'em one by one by pushing on the little toggle switch to the song you want.
4- It is overpriced at $40

Later I try to use my $20 adapter on my new desktop and find that it won't power on, and after a couple of hours of troubleshooting and following instructions in the official forums, I found that the ONLY solution was to plug the adapter back into the system from which it was removed, so the system can re-initialize the radio.

8452513,"I just opened this up and plugged it in, so I can't speak to the longevity.
It's compact for a full sized external drive, smaller than my wife's G-Raid drives. I love that it has two Firewire400 ports, a Firewire800 port, eSata, and USB3.0. I can connect this to anything. Having two Firewire400 ports makes it possible to daisychain multiple Firewire400 drives which is very convenient. I was also impressed that it came with cables for each of the different kinds of ports.
Included Cables (1 of each)
- USB 3.0 (will work with USB2.0 and USB1.0 ports but at reduced speeds)
- eSata
- Firewire 400
- Firewire 800

Plugging it in, I found that my drive was already formatted for HFS+ for my Mac which was a big plus for me. It's also very quiet. I'm doing a TimeMachine backup as I type this and the drive is quietly humming along next to me. I can barely hear it, but definitely not loud. There is a blue light behind the front grill that lights with drive activity. The power cord has a converter at the plug and is about 6 feet long.

The drive comes with a stand for vertical positioning, as pictured. The stand is not attached though, so it's very easy and more compact to lay the drive on its side horizontally.

2045079,"I've been using this Linksys router for a few weeks now. The wireless connection range and speed are satisfactory, but I haven't really done anything to really put a work load on it, so I can't say for sure it'll always be reliable. So far it's been good to me.

The Network Magic software is basically pointless, unless you have no experience at all with computers and need someone to hold your hand through every step of setting things up. The fact that the basic package included with the product doesn't include the Pro features like shared printing and folders seems ridiculous. Why should I have to pay money for features that come free with Windows 7?

On the bright side, the router seems to have no trouble serving a variety of different devices. The wireless printing did work during the free trial of Pro, and all our other computing devices, including my Windows laptop, a Mac OS X laptop, and a Nintendo Wii, have all been able to get on and stay on the network with no issues.

Overall, the Linksys router is functional, but not the greatest investment I've ever made. For anyone looking to buy a wireless router, I would suggest doing some research and looking for a router that actually supports all the functionality it claims to (wireless printing, shared folders, etc) without asking you to pay extra for a software license. If you really can't afford a much better one, this router will work and serve you pretty well, but it's just not as good as similar wireless network devices.",3.0
2343321,"I have the light blue model of this camera, and bought Amazon for $129. I am using it (with a friend's identical unit, I talked her into buying) to film her exercise classes. We ensure we have the same settings so when edited later, our colors match.

So think of using one of your cameras on tripod for overall scene, and use another camera or camcorder for another angle, zooms and closeups. Actually, we have two of these at different angles, and my Sony Camcorder handling details and roaming shots. Now I just have to learn Vegas 6 so I can use multiple cameras. (I think the latest iMovie will handle multi camera shots, but not any cheapo video editing programs).

So...when I talked my friend into getting this camera, the price was at $100. I didn't complain...I had paid $129. Prices drop. O well. But when her associate wanted to get one too, we discovered prices for the different colors very high...the FS3 ranged from $139 to $185 to $249. Why the price differences, when the only difference is the color. What happened to the $100 price? As new models are released, don't the older models drop in price?

17569655,"The thing that sets this mini system apart from the rest is its *dedicated* DVD bay & 5.1 Dolby AC-3 decoder. Other systems integrate a DVD/CD changer all into one bay, but if that breaks (and they're always the 1st thing to go) then you are in for a big hassel. Other systems also do not offer the same type of high-end dolby surround decoding. The 5 surround speakers turn your room into a virtual movie theater; the speaker seperation during DVD playback is well worth the price of this system.  However, one minor disapointment in this system for me is that the 5 speakers work in DVD mode ONLY & when the DVD is especially encoded for AC-3 5.1 dolby surround sound. Radio and CD playback only play on the two main speakers and the system does not do ""dolby pro logic"" seperation to distribute the sound evenly to all 5 speakers. This is something I am only learning about now and I wish it had been made clearer in the product specs. It's just dissapointing to have all these speakers set up and have them only work when in one mode and the rest of the time remain silent. I checked one other system at the store, an AIWA mini DVD system, and it did offer sound on all 5 speakers when in radio, tape, and CD mode. Although the DVD decoding was not as good as this model's.  Thus, on any account, it seems when you buy any of these intergrated mini systems you have to make compromises. For this model you compromise Radio & CD on all 5 speakers. You also compromise a double tape deck for the dedicated DVD bay--but who really needs tapes anymore nowadays anyway? But, overall this model is the best deal, especially price-wise through Amazon. It offers the best sound decoding for DVDs, AND the ability to play VCDs, and CDRs & CDRWs--a feature absent on almost all other comparable DVD mini systems. You also get to change CDs while one is playing, another thing you cannot do on other systems. Right now, I'd say this is the best DVD mini system in the price & feature range among major competitors (Panasonic, Sony, AIWA & Pioneer). Hope this helps you all make your decisions!",4.0

The only problem that I had with it, was that the flash stop working one day, and when I called Sony they help me over the phone, and the camera was fixed in the spot... And the Customer Service at Sony was great too....

It's pretty easy to use, even for people that have never used a digital camera before.

I read that somebody said that he's not gonna buy Sony anymore, well too bad for him.... I love Sony so much that I have almost everything Sony, and the best part is that I can put my camera memory stick in the Sony TV and in my Sony laptop and I can view the pictures, without using any cables.... That is just amazing!!!

6726291,"If you know anything about SSD's, you know that Intel makes the most reliable ones. People always complain, out of ignorance, that SSD's aren't as ""reliable"" or ""dependable"" as traditional Hard Drives. Look at the MTBF (mean time between failures) and you'll clearly see how this is a myth. The MTBF measures what the average lifespan of a product is, and is a clear indicator of what you can expect from electronics. Also, if you analyze return rates and return reasoning, you will find which products are considered to be superior in quality. All of these analyses were done with a QC mentality in Operations mindset. That being said, this SSD is probably faster than anything I can throw at it and complete overkill, but that's how I like it. Let time catch up to the product. Intel makes the best SSD's hands down, so just go with it. If you see these on sale and do a good price comparison, just get it. I believe the higher end 520 series is usually a little pricier, but if you find that on sale, get it. STRONGLY RECOMMEND ALL INTEL SSD products.

8864054,"This is a good armband for my iPod. I like the silicone ""stretch around the iPod"" design more than the ""armband just has a pouch you stuff the ipod into"" style.  It will not fit with even a ultra slim case on, but that is fine by me- I have a dedicated gym-only ipod and therefore this band is the case.
It fits my arm well- I am not bodybuilder large, but I have found that many bands rated to 18"" are very tight (my arm is maybe 16.5"" tops) , so I went with this one based on its 21"" max.  I felt the extra leeway space could come in handy for a nice fit.
It passes with flying colors in that regard:  fit well and didn't move around during a workout.

There are a few cons:  (minor) I wish it had one of those small cord organizers on the band so I could shorten my cord easily. As it is made, I have to just stuff the extra cord in the band itself.  (major) it has a cutout for the front facing camera, but not one for the rear camera. I find that to be a major design flaw.  I am never going to take a selfie or use Facetime while at the gym, however I actually do like to use the rear camera to take a snapshot of the cardio machine's ""workout summary"" so I can capture all the details without having to manually write them in a workout log or frantically text them into a note before the machine's screen times out.
I have an iPod Touch 5th gen, so I am using the correct model this case is marketed for, so it is not like the rear camera issue is because I am using the wrong case.
That is an inconvenience, but not enough to return the case. For the most part, I mainly just record calories burned and the extra info captured in a photo is ""just because.""

I plugged everything in installed the software walked through the steps and then I was online. I connected to the wireless by using the passkey> very easy even for a grandma like me. So far I have twice the speed I had on the 2 wire( I have ATT elite service suppose to get 6000mbps download and 768 upload) It has never reached those speeds using the 2wire.

18685805,"For a price well under $100, the Hitachi DVP325U comes with a very sensible, easy-to-use remote and a decent picture.  It's remote control and user-interface are simple and intuitive.  For instance, to change the audio track (e.g., from English to English w/ commentary), you simply repeatedly press the ""audio"" button; other brands require you to first press an ""audio"" button and then press up and down or left and right to scroll through the various tracks (e.g., Samsung).  The DVP325U also contains quite a few features, including zoom, simulated surround-sound, a programmable remote (to control your TV's volume, etc.), and a jog-dial and control buttons on the face of the unit.  All of the features are well-executed; for instance, with the zoom function an onscreen display approximates which portion of the whole image is being enlarged.  Finally, the DVP325U has both optical and coaxial audio outputs for those playing the sound through a nice stereo system.  Despite an excellent interface and a lot of options that aren't usually available on cheaper DVD players, the DVP325U's picture is slightly less than perfect.  In movies, smooth gradiants tend to show some banding of color and ""stair-stepped"" edges and boundaries.  Generally this is only noticeable if you look very closely, but it makes an otherwise fantastic budget DVD player just short of perfect.  Overall though, the user-interface and the features were so well designed, that I opted to keep this DVD player over a similarly-priced Samsung player which had a top-notch picture, but difficult controls.  Lastly, the Hitachi DVP323U (threee-twenty-THREE), which you might also come across, is identical to the DVP325U, except that it lacks an optical output and 3 buttons (""subtitle,"" ""audio,"" and ""surround"") on the face of the unit.",4.0

I had one Sandisk which I have used for making backups for 2 years but I needed more so (looking for a bargain and thinking erroneously that an ""interface is an interface""), I purchased 3 from a different manufacturer but immediately encountered problems with all 3 of this less expensive brand: firstly they would not install unless they were plugged into a USB port on the computer and not on a port extender, and more troublesome, I encountered sdhc card corruption on more than one occasion.  With my old well used Sandisk this had never happened so I tossed the bargain interfaces and purchased 3 more Sandisk instead - and they are all working wonderfully.

I'll have to spend a lot more time tweaking and playing with some of the additional settings to see if I can get this to make a noticeable difference and can update the review with my findings; but for now am quite disappointed with the results.  Currently all my settings are set to auto and I would have assumed leaving it at Unifi's auto settings that I would see a noticeable difference which I just don't.

I guess much of my disappointment is because literally all of the other Unifi products I have purchased I've been absolutely thrilled with.  I think they dropped the ball on this one somehow.  I get that they were trying to keep costs down which is a major reason so many use their hardware as its rock solid and am going to assume that they figured many of their users were going to use the cameras for indoor applications and thus didn't want to make the camera overly expensive including the additional IR LED's but think if that was the case they should have come out with a seperate indoor only camera and an outdoor camera instead of going with the add-on route.",2.0

18543007,"This Bluetooth module is great for Arduino. I was looking for any kind of Bluetooth chip for Arduino and stumbled across this one. It has an xbee form factor which means that it should work on any xbee-compatible shield. I bought it along with a simple xbee shield for my Arduino Uno and have not been disappointed. Took me about a week to get a sketch up and running, but I found great documentation from seeedstudio's online wiki (just google 'Bluetooth Bee documentation'). I had never programmed an Arduino until I got one for Christmas this past year. I got the Bluetooth Bee and the xbee shield and within a week or two of receiving them, I was controlling LED's with my Android phone. I would recommend having some good programming experience under your belt before tackling anything Bluetooth related (I ended having to write my own Android app), but if you're ready to take on the challenge, I would completely recommend this chip! Xbee shields are widely available and make interfacing with this module super easy and relatively cheap. The range is pretty good too.

The Good: Bright colors make hooking up multiple devices to your hub a breeze. You can easily tell at a glance what device is going where, and with the 4 printers we use professionally and personally, this makes troubleshooting and installation a snap. Very thoughtfully,  even the twist ties are colored to match.

The Bad: no complaints whatsoever.

Improvements: Adding in labels to go with the twist ties would be great. Velcro cable straps, while more expensive, are also a more 'finished' looking option.

15783370,"I got these primarily for cell phone conversations because I don't like to hold a phone to my ear and have a hard time understanding people if I use the phone's speaker.

Like other reviewers have noted, you can hear the cord if it rubs against almost anything; if there is no sound going through the buds I can actually hear the cord rubbing against my shirt when I turn my head from side to side. (I have another set of buds that came with my Roku and will try them although I seem to remember they also had some cable sound.) This, so far is the only down side of these ear buds.

Phone conversations are much clearer than the phone provides; I can understand people with low quality phones much better now. I have listened only to MP3 quality music via my phone and am very satisfied with the sound quality. No, the buds don't have the detail of my Grado ST225's but they are much smaller, more portable and I don't look like I have cans over my ears.

The build quality appears first-rate and time will tell how well they hold up. I expect these will last years unless misused. Not sure why they are billed as ""noise canceling"" as I found with any ear bud I have used that by design, they isolate you from external noise. (The cable being the exception.) Why the industry insists on gold plated connectors I have yet to understand; Silver is a better conductor...look it up. <grin>

18400810,"As in my product review for the empty systainer, my only nitpick is that of price. If this were 40% cheaper, this would be a no-brainer 5-star product for me. This kit is basically a plastic box with wood tenons and four fancy drill bits, but it is well designed. I like the Festool domino system very much and I like the way these interlock so I can keep all the Festool related gear together.

My shop is crowded, so a neat stack of these interlocked to each other and to the top of my Festool dust collector keeps this system orderly, manueverable and most of all, identifiable. This system is easy to lose if storing it separately. The tools would end up in one drawer, the bits would end up in another and the tenons could become a disheveled mess of containers and bags. This system keeps them all together and organized so I can find everything when I need it.

Each systainer has its own handle, so if I just need the tool and some tenons for a job, I just unlatch those systainers and take them separately. If I need the whole shebang, I just wheel it around on the rolling vacuum to where it is needed and then break it down.

I don't know if I trust these to take a drop onto concrete, but they seem pretty sturdy. No problems with things cracking or warping yet.

This is a very good soundbar which I'm using for a t.v. in a fairly small room (which I didn't want to worsen with tons of cords supporting a surround-sound speaker system). The sound is vastly superior to the sound from the tv's speaker. This is especially true for voices. You can select several different levels of voice support, useful for different viewing situations (including movies with strong scores or sound effects). I use it too to stream the music channels that I get through cable. The sound there is robust with a fairly deep sound 'stage', conveying the depth of the music.  The only downside I found is that the remote (tiny) can be a little difficult to operate, but there's a way to sync other remotes to the unit.

1786152,"I bought the LaCie 2big Network Ethernet 2-Disk RAID system to provide a common repository for company files for a small business (<10 employees).  The intent was to allow employees in the office and those working remotely to have access to the same set of files, while at the same time using the RAID feature to provide a backup of the company files in case of a drive failure (scheduled system backups are also performed on a weekly basis).

The experience for workers on the same internal network as the drive is great as they can map the shares to drives and the performance is fast.

However, the experience for remote users is poor.  The accessible shares are listed in the order created, and cannot be changed.  Thus, users must search through the list of shares to find the desired share.  The directories in each share only appear after selecting the share title.  This is true of every sub-directory, as well.  To make things worse, after uploading a file, the directory tree disappears and you have to work your way back through the tree again (many clicks).  Finally, the delete file feature does not appear to work for remote users.  So if you load the wrong file or load it to the wrong directory, you have to have someone else clean up your error.  Basically, the ethernet agent software provided with the drive is crap.  Finally, upload and download times are slow for remote users.

An alternative for small businesses looking to provide remote users access to a common repository of company files would be a software product like Microsoft Groove.  Unfortunately, like most Microsoft products, it's priced for companies making billions of dollars a year and not small businesses.",3.0

When I first started to dabble in the MP3 portable jukebox arena, I started to quite vigorously study the pros and cons of all players on offer and the Iriver won with flying colours.. The Ipod, at the time, had many flaws..  They have since, rectified a few of these but it was great to read a bad review of this product.. Are people finally waking up to the crap Apple are pushing onto the public.. If you advertise enough, put enough backing behind a product, a lemon could be the next MP3 player..

It is a little chunkier but a small price to pay for a player that doesn't require crappy drivers for every computer you connect to to load songs, files etc.. No copyright crap..  It can record voice, outside sources and has FM built in all for the same price.. The Ipod requires many accesories to require all this.. The Mysic River site  informs you on how to upgrade your hard drive, making it bigger, changing batteries and even skins.. The Iriver has more versatility than a lot of players I have researched..

Firstly these are a very nice pair of Bluetooth headphones because they fit in your ear perfectly and execute the task they are for very well. In the box the headphones are laid out very nicely and when you pull out the headphones there is a nice travel case which can perfectly keep the headphones safe, there is also a USB to micro USB charging wire some spare earbuds and an instructions manual.
To connect the ear phones to your phone you have to hold the power button for a few seconds until the light flashes red and blue then you have to connect them. There is a voice indicator which tells you when the headphones are on, off or need charge. The headphones also feature a microphone so you can use the headphones hand free and use the headphones without your phone in hand.
When you first use the headphones you notice that the headphones fit in perfectly and are very comfortable and do not fall out even when moving around a lot and running. One downside with the headphones are when in use you can notice that the sound quality is a bit flat and could do with a bit more bass at the price they are featured at.
The headphones themselves have very nice range before they start to go fuzzy and the battery in the headphones are very nice and they charge in about 2 hours and have about 10 hours use. As gym earphones these are also a very nice pair and are comfortable and fit in amazingly.
Overall these are a very nice pair of headphones that are very comfortable and have decent sound quality but are amazing if you are using them for sports. So if you are looking for a nice pair of Bluetooth headphones for the gym or jogging I would definitely recommend these.

Night vision is a great feature at this price point, too!  I love that the recordings are stored online and are viewable by computer or mobile device, because I've always feared getting a fancy security system and then getting the DVR stolen!  I honestly wish I'd gotten the 3-camera set since it was only $100 more than the 2-camera bundle with a mount included, and an individual camera is $159.  I ordered these cameras and they arrived within 12 hours (Prime one-day shipping is amazing).  The mount arrived the next day.

I love that the cameras are wireless so they're easy to install; we have a small house, so connecting to wireless from the front and the back of the house is easy.  With bigger houses, you'd need a more powerful wifi network.  The only negative is that I wish I could find rechargeable batteries for them, but in the meantime I just ordered a bunch of regular ones - no idea how long they will last.",5.0

So this is my second pair of these headphones.  Initially I loved them, but the more I used them the more I noticed my music would skip when performing basic movements such as bending down to pick something up.  It will also sometimes completely lose connection and then be undiscoverable by my device.  I was willing to deal with that but now I've noticed that the wires have started to pull away from the earbuds, exposing the inner wires, after only a few months of light use.  I will not be purchasing these again.

2948721,"Small and unobtrusive. Approximately 6.25"" tall x 6.5"" wide x 1/2"" thick when unfolded and not counting the 3-foot rabbit ears.

If you are trying to tune VHF channels, I don't see how this would be any better than any other rabbit ears, but for UHF it is excellent.

Using HDHomeRun tuner I am able to easily and consistently pick up 118 (mostly worthless) channels with antenna positioned well inside apartment, 20 feet from nearest window, not even pointing toward broadcast towers which are 20 miles away. Previous antennas couldn't get over 10 channels and required repositioning contortions every channel change.

Received all CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX and PBS stations, plus This, Bounce, Ion, and the usual assortment of infomercial, public access, foreign language, shopping, and religious stations.

For 14 bucks I can't complain, but you should know:
- 6 ft. cable is thin and connects to antenna internally (see photo). You can't easily replace it if you want a longer cable or if it's damaged.
- Rabbit ears are flimsy, but if most of your channels are UHF like mine, you won't have to use the ears much.
- No mounting options.

The only negative I found was that it takes considerable patience to install it correctly. All dust must be meticulously removed from the display using the provided cloth as instructed, and then the screen must be lifted over any areas with air bubbles and reapplied while stroking with the edge of a credit card. It took me almost an hour to install it, and I almost knocked the rating down to four stars for that reason.

However, once installed, the screen is virtually invisible and works very well. There is no other product I found to be suitable for the highly glossy laptop screen. More expensive versions do not appear to be laptop compatible, and the cheaper versions are impossible to install without sizable air bubbles and are no good at reducing glare.

I can always charge about 1.6ghz cpu tablets and below with this and other sturdy cables like Anker brand and Volutz brand but not higher.

4033559,"I originally purchased this product to use with my PS3's eye camera. In my living room I have a projector connected to my PS3 with it projecting on the opposite wall which is about 12 feet away. I need this cable because the eye camera connects to the PS3 via a USB cable. The eye's cable is only 6 feet long and I wanted to run the cable along the crown molding on the ceiling to keep it mostly out of sight. To do this I estimated that I would need approximately 28 feet of extension to run the cable down to the floor from the mounted projector, over to the corner, up the wall and behind the molding to the eye which I mounted atop the molding on the wall opposite the projector.
 I bought this cable because I saw that it got several good reviews and even had a few reviews from people using it for their PS3 eye. I was later disappointed after I had everything setup because my PS eye kept cutting out. Signal transmission would stay pretty consistent unless I made too many moves or moved too quickly. What is the point of a motion camera if it can't detect motion???
I still have it mounted up mostly because I am too lazy to take it down again, and maybe I was just given a dud. But let this be a warning to anyone. TEST IT BEFORE YOU HAVE IT MOUNTED somewhere where it would be a pain to get down again.",3.0

The fans are super massive so expect to cram it in if your PC case is a lean form factor ATX. You might need a slightly chunkier, wider case for it. I even had to replace one of its fans with a smaller Noctua fan to have it fit properly on my armored motherboard (and I put the big fan that came with D15 to the front panel.

Two are:
-clip out from the speaker so you can put the earpiece in place
-clip in to hold it against your ear.

The other two are at the bracket that holds the clip:
-pulls upwards one ""notch"" (call it ""open"") which is about 1/8"".  This effectively lowers the speaker when on your ear by that amount.
-pushed down as pictured (call it ""closed"")

On my ears, they feel loose, but the clips do hold them; albeit a little away from the ear even in the ""clip in"" position.  They are lightweight, and the speaker ""cover"" is cloth, not foam...a plus.  The black wiring used seems durable, but is easily tangled.

4381896,"I ordered 3 of the mCovers for our Kindles, two in black and one in green.  After reviewing every Kindle cover Amazon had to offer I chose the mCover for these reasons.

1.  Small, sleek and easy to carry whether in my purse, while traveling or just around the house.  I personally like the Kindle without a case but the risk of damaging it due to dropping it, seemed too high.

2.  Price was a big factor because I needed to buy 3 and as I stated, I wasn't sure I wanted to have a cover on my Kindle, at all times.  The mCovers are leather and very well made but still quite inexpensive compared to many of the others, even with shipping added in.  I couldn't see spending $60 when I only spent $140 for my Kindle!

3.  The mCovers come in several color choices.  Having two Kindles in the house and a third close by made it necessary to have a color option so we wouldn't accidentally take each other's Kindles.

4.  Reviews from other buyers.  I purchase through Amazon on a very regular basis and don't buy anything without reading reviews although I very seldom leave my own reviews.  Feeling a little guilty I decided to give back and add my two cents worth.  This is a great product, very easy to slide your Kindle in and out of and protects my Kindle with style.

- It's not a crowded keyboard with a bunch of superfluous functions.  Very clean, simple and minimalist design that looks great.
- The keys have great feel producing a satisfying click when pressed.  There is minimal travel and the keys don't feel mushy at all.  I find it comfortable to type for long periods on this keyboard - it is very ergonomic.
- Wireless works great out of the box with Window 7 and has good range if needed for presentation style setups.  Can't comment on battery life but since there are not a lot of extraneous lights and functions on the keyboard I'm hopeful it will be long lasting.

3328566,"I bought this as many have done for an ir receiver so I could use my Logitech Harmony 880 remote as my good lady loaths it (she is far from being a techie, etc). I waited a month before writing a review.

It is literally a plug and play device with Windows 7 x64 Ultimate, but a small piece of double sided tape would have been a nice touch, as without such keeping the sensor in the place you wish is not always easy.  Saying that though I do agree it is a bit like a Cylon Centurion blinking at you when it has an incoming signal and the red light flashing.

As this lives on the computer in our bedroom I handed the remote to the better half as I use the Harmony that took a little research to find the correct settings for (thanks previous poster) the Harmony and it is working well for me. She uses it in conjunction with the TV remote as that is more to her liking (I don't argue LOL#, but is has helped me convert her to WMC, especially as we have the Netflix add in.  Saying that, the mouse button has come in handy with a quirk using Netflix on demand when one wishes to move onto the next episode of whatever season of a show you are watching.  Using the navigation arrows frequently make the other shows behind the show you are watch scroll through the choices.  A simple move of the mouse re-centers the remote so you can down button to another episode.  Odd and a quirk but don't know whether to blame the remote or the Netflix add in.

So phase one in my plan to convert my good lady to WMC actually worked so onto phase two of putting in a TV tuner #Avertv HD Duet from Amazon, and if it works I will put as second one in for the maximum 4 tuners allowed by WMC) which I will do next week and probably update this after a little usage with both.

I shopped around quite a bit a decided on this one because of it's size and the fact that it gets its power directly from the ipod, making it truely ""wireless"".

Now, before buying, check out your radio and see if you actually have a station that's not taken. It's amazing how many are where I live(small town TN). Once you can find one, the transmitter works great. It's very easy to use, and even has a light for night time use.

I will say that if you live in Atlanta that this is probably not the one for you. My wife and I had to drive through there  yesterday, and we could not find a single station that it would work on. I don't know if there was just way too much interference or if the signal strength wasn't enough, but we had to wait until we were a good 30 to 40 minutes away from Atl. before we could listen to it.

19294306,"So the headline I wrote for this was ""almost perfect"" and it's about as apt a description I can give. The features I wanted were: direct iPod control for an iPod connected to the USB-A port (lots of people and the manual say the remote wouldn't work but it does), preamp output so I can use it with my current active speakers, real amped outputs for some as of yet undetermined passive speakers, a quality headphone amp, and wireless capability. This is the core of a desktop/bedroom system so the size was important as well and having the vertical orientation is brilliant.  The only misses for me on the D7050 are the fickle touch control power button (turning it on is easy, off is a bit of a chore but the remote is what I use instead), mini headphone jack (would've preferred full size) and lastly the occasionally tempermental volume level.

Listening through my current Audioengine speakers and pumping in ALAC files from the iPod, the sound is well balanced and enjoyable. It misses a bit on the low and high frequencies but everything in the middle is well represented but that's probably more of an omission the speakers make than the NAD. Hooking the D7050 to some older Sonus Faber Grand Piano Domus towers, the sound was much better than I expected. The amp section didn't sound ""stressed"" during difficult sections of music and even with only 50 watts available, I was able to drive the speakers pretty loudly in a good sized room. The headphone section is bit better than anticipated, certainly better than a laptop or iDevice (which have good output sections just not great power).  I have Beyerdynamic T90 Jubilees which have a great open sound with lots of detail buuuuut can be a bit strident/sibilant and the NAD headphone section calms it down without losing the detail.

After having the problem, I (too late) saw lots of people leaving App Store reviews with the same issue as well as on the Belkin website. I contacted Belkin for assistance. They responded by sending one email a day, asking for further information each time and some of the questions repeated several times.

What does the box look like?: The box shows all important instructions needed, and showed how to setup the HD VIDEO CAPTURE and start recording.

As of opening the box, all the contents that were listed on the box [and amazon page] were there.

As of plugging in the box to my PS4, by following all directions in order to record your gameplay, and after turning off HDCP through the PS4s system settings, the screen successfully passed through the HD VIDEO CAPTURE. The screen took a little bit to go from a black screen to the PS4, so don't start worrying if this happens to you.

937943,"I only trust my vinyl collection to a vintage turntable (in my case a very nice 70's era AR-XA with a Pickering cartridge).  As others have noted, such turntables produce an output that needs to be passed through a separate pre-amp.  Receivers in the past had a pre-amp incorporated via a designated phono input.  My old receiver bit the dust, so I procured a nice Yamaha only to find on arrival it did not have a phono input, and hence no pre-amp (and that apparently is now the case for most if not all manufacturers).  I chose this pre-amp based on its favorable reviews, its small size, and its modest price point.  From my perspective it has more than proven to be an excellent solution for my particular turntable.  Setup was trivial - you just plug your phono into it and run a patch cord to an available audio input on the receiver.  There is a ground input on the pre-amp if your turntable requires one (the AR does not).  I have absolutely no complaint about quality of output, although I hasten to add I am by no means an audiophile.  I can't speak to the advantages of the rumble filter or the 100pF/200pF capacitance adjustments since the Pickering cartridge works great regardless of setting and my AR turntable doesn't have rumble issues.  The major downside of the product is its lack of off/on switch, not a good thing given the very bright blue LED that is on whenever it is powered (and which is why I decided to rate it 4 stars instead of 5).

16430277,"I was surprised at how nice the Muzee backpack looked when I first got it in the mail. The bag is a full canvas pack with leather straps and suede zippers. It has a total of 4 zippers. The first zipper is for the main storage compartment, which itself contains a laptop pouch and a smaller zippered pocket. The laptop pouch provides a perfect fit for a ~13"" laptop, such as a 13.3"" MacBook Pro. The smaller zippered compartment will sit between your back and the laptop, so you'll only want to store flatter items here, such as your cell phone, passport, ID cards, etc. The remainder of this main compartment can easily fit several books, but who carries books anymore? I usually only put one book with my tablet.

The outer horizontal zipper reveals a deep pocket. I easily fit my Totes umbrella with plenty of room to spare. The vertical zipper shares a fabric wall with the previously mentioned pocket. Therefore, the space is somewhat shared between these two pockets. If you fill one up, it'll bulge into the other one. I keep a change of clothes here.

Although the bag is quite nice, it does lack some cushioning that's found on many other bags nowadays. For example, there is no cushioning in the laptop pouch area at all. If you travel with a laptop, you'll probably want a dedicated laptop case. The straps have some cushioning, but I feel they could have been a bit more generous with it. These seem minor to me though, as it still feels just fine on my shoulders.

At this writing,  Quad Mount has been installed 2 weeks, so far, so good. May add the 5th star after a year's service.
Sure opens up desk space nicely.
Has placed weight distribution boards (nicely decorated) to reinforce mounting clamp (top & bottom) to desk. Guesses total weight of mount & 24"" monitors is approximately 60lbs (27.2kg,)+ (very top heavy), & will increase w/ the addition of the 27"".
Uses a 'Light Touch' when adjusting monitors, if necessary.
Monitors can be rotated 180 degrees.if cables lengths allow. (*** NOTE: Cable lengths are a critical consideration so undo stress is NOT accidentally placed upon desk clamps & desk. ***)
Reminds self to check desk mounting clamps weekly to insure I don't scrap $800 of monitors. (Has memo alarm scheduled on each system.)
No cons at this time.

I do recommend making some simple modifications to the case before you put it on (so you don't have to take it back off later). The biggest, likely most important (if you use the speakers anyway) is to remove the black sticky strip over where the speaker port is; if you don't, it will make rattling sounds that make you think your speakers are going bad, when really it's just them vibrating this ""protective"" strip. There are also silicon pieces of the case that cover the speakers and the camera which we removed, as leaving them on there and trying to use either means they end up getting in the way (these are the silicon molded pieces; the hard plastic shell is still around those areas, and doesn't interfere).

Got it 31 Oct from Verizon (overnight)

Pros:
Looks: yes, it is square, but gorgeous, silicon band and core blends into nice looking modern watch. And square means better apps support (read easier to develop)
Offline GPS: tracks activities w/o phone
Display: whole not that stunning indoors, but very impressive outdoors in sunlight
Detachable core: Can use it inside watertight bag for my salt water adventures
Android wear: unified os, works great. apps are spawning quickly. Even Asus Remote Camera dedigned for zenwatch works and I rooted it following lg g watch method
Ip68: can swim in non saline water w/o worries
Battery: even with abnormal use of first days by installing/uninstalling, GPS, voice input, etc I was left with 56% at 10pm (took out of charge at 7am)

Cons:
-Sony official apps are yet to be updated (e.g. lifelog to track sleep...)
-most of sport/fitness trackers does not support offline (without phone) mode as if Nov 2014
-no offline maps yet
-GPS has great sensitivity, but sometimes momentarily goes off rails, likely fixable by firmware
-lack of accessories yet.

Bottom line: I'm quite happy with it and do not think anything comes close yet if you need offline capable unit and can wait for app support. If you are after pure looks in square - IMHO this one is the best, if round watches attracts you- try all of them and see for yourself.

I work with a lot of music projects and hundreds of audio files, and prefer them to be on portable drives.  I need to store everything externally, and actually do it twice for backup.  With Seagate, I can trust my data is safe and preserved.  I have never had a problem with the security of this brand.  If you are looking to update or upgrade, this is a great way to do it as you can interchange the adapter with several drives.

For portable drives, it makes it much easier to keep everything connected to your notebook as you simply switch-out the drives from the adapter as needed.

16807201,"I've been on Wacom tablets for years, I'm always looking for alternatives because while Wacom is the industry standard it isn't without flaws. My last two Wacom models had annoying issues so I'm always open to try new products. I've been on this one since April and it's performed really well, only issues I've had is if I use the wireless mode sometimes it becomes non responsive and I have to re-seat the wireless receiver to continue working. In all fairness my Wacom did this too so anymore I stick to wired mode.
The size on this is perfect and I especially like the fact that the pen nips don't wear out like the Wacom ones, I literally paint all day every day on my tablets so it's annoying to see wear after a day's worth of use. The Huion pen doesn't suffer this fate, I've been on the same pen nib since I bought this and there's only a slight wear at the tip.
Pressure sensitivity is there and works perfectly with custom brushes in the programs I use. In case you're wondering I paint in the following programs and haven't had issues:
ArtRage 5, Autodesk Sketchbook Pro, Photoshop, Krita, Rebelle 2 & Paintstorm Studio.

This tablet doesn't have the tilt support but I never used that feature anyway, seriously...when holding a real pencil or paintbrush do you tilt it in any other direction than off to the side? Any other direction seems awkward and quite frankly is a gimmick.
The hotkeys are easy to configure and access while working and I'm a big fan of the buttons being just that, buttons. You don't see any distracting overlays or additional software that pops up telling you which button you're pushing.

I noticed some people were having issues with this model so here are the specs I'm using:
Windows 10 Pro
i7 4970K
16GB ram

About three weeks later the screen starts flipping and flickering. The display is still ""working,"" it's still connected to the computer and is on. But nothing shows on the screen for a few seconds, it just keeps flickering. I unplug the VGA and replug it back in, omg it works! The same scenario happened continually for the next 3 months, once a day at least if not more. Every time I unplugged/replugged the VGA it worked fine again, so I basically ignored this issue for a while.

Last week, the usual happened. This time though the display didn't just flicker annoyingly, it flatout died. The blue blinking power light is on, my laptop is still aware that it's connected to an external monitor, but nothing shows on the freaking thing. Last week it was one of the monitors, and I assumed it was awful luck, but the same thing is happening with the second one this week.

I'm assuming these things only last a few months and then die. It's a nice way for Samsung to suck the money out of you. You will be pleased the first few weeks, and maybe even the first month, but once the flickering starts you. are. DOOMED.

Pros:

Obviously the best feature is the ease of switching between portrait/landscape viewing
The soft backing on the removable case is very soft, not a rough ""velcro""
The leather used is good quality, and looks comparable to much more expensive leather cases.
The auto on/off feature works seamlessly for the new iPad (iPad 3).
The profile of the case is quite thin, yet it maintains enough structure to be sufficiently sturdy.

Neutral:
The magnets generally keep the case closed well enough, but do not provide a strong ""magnetic adhesion"" that might be expected - this does not cause problems.
The size of the case is big enough to house the new Ipad (even with a Zagg leather back), but does gap up just a bit on the front because it's so snug - there is no difficulty in getting the iPad in or out of the case however.

Cons:
No concrete ""typing"" angle - it does allow you to rest the iPad with the cover flipped underneath, but provides a bit of a bouncy surface.

The back left side of the removable case very slightly bulges out due to the Velcro strap holding the iPad in - this is minor, and does not detract from it laying flat when out of the protective cover.

Overall, the case has been very suitable for a multitude of working conditions and looks to be holding up very well to daily use.

9873982,"I am so happy that I bought the Garmin Forerunner 220.  The watch is very light and not too big on the wrist - it is the perfect size. It is extremely easy to use and picks up a GPS signal very quickly.  The toughest part was connecting to Garmin Connect to upload my run, but I am pretty sure it's a windows 8 thing.  I always use Chrome and desktop mode, but to use the program you have to use chrome in app mode, and I dislike app mode.  I ended up switching to IE and was finally able to set up my profile and whatnot.  I did try opening the software program, but it would not recognize that my watch was plugged into the USB drive, even though my computer was able to recognize the device.

20546897,"Great case for the price! When I bought the iPad mini 4, I wanted a smart case. Of course, Apple discontinued them so I had to get a third party case. I purchased Apple's Smart Cover in ""midnight blue,"" and this case is noticeable darker. Of course, advertises itself to be ""navy blue"" and there's no doubt that it's navy when you look at it.

Firstly, whoever said the case has a lemony smell is completely correct. It's certainly not a bad smell, nor is it overpowering, but I definitely smell it. In terms of appearance, it looks exactly as I hoped it would. Very sleek, no logos. Does not add a lot of bulk to the iPad.

It's easy to get the iPad in and out of the case, but there is enough hold that I am not worried the iPad will pop out without me wanting it to. The cover puts the iPad to sleep with no issues like I'd expect a Smart cover/case to.

The cut out for headphones works fine with the Apple headphones you'd get with an iPhone. It seems somewhat narrow, but I've had no issue. The cut out for the volume buttons make it a little awkward to access, but I feel I will get used to this over time. They are definitely accessible though.

Without going into too much detail, it kept saying ""WARNING"" every 30 seconds or so.  I muted the volume and it continued to warn of unpaved roads ahead?  I restarted the device several times and still found the GPS to be completely inaccurate and unreliable.  As I traveled down the highway toward our destination, it wanted me to spontaneously exit for no reason.  When continuing, it would insist on making a U-turn, instead of re-routing and continuing on the same road (this would continue for over 10 miles beyond the missed exit).  I finally put it away back in the box.  Thank goodness for my iPhone's GPS.

Returned from our trip and contacted tech support.  Again, without going into the details, I spent HOURS on the phone, performed upgrades (on my NEW GPS) and it's doing the same things.

It can be discrete under your desk or in your living room. But it has plenty of room on the inside for drives and airflow. Very sleek and modern.

My only complaint is how bright the power led is. I had it in my bedroom for a while and I had to disconnect that light. It lit up the entire room when I was going to sleep.

The power supply has held up great. I had an AMD Athlon and a 7770 in it initially. Moved to an overclocked g3258 and a gtx 960. Ive since built a new rig and my wife uses the Rosewill and the pentium for her work computer. She's still trucking after 3 years.

So if your looking for a budget build this is a great solution. The case is plenty has plenty of room for expansion.

The fist one is that it did not come with any kind of bag, I have to travel with it, and if it had come with some type of sleeve or something to protect the keys when its in a bag that would have been super helpful ( I have been looking online for something but have not found anything that will work yet.)

The other is that there just needs to be a little more connectivity with the hotkey buttons and the xoom.  The keyboard does a lot of quick things to bring up specific programs, but its also lacking some that would be really helpful.  I also wish that I could create my own custom quick buttons.  Its nice to have these functions but is annoying when I have my xoom plugged into my TV and im across the room using the keyboard and then you realize that you cant get to what you need to, so you have to get up and walk across the room so you can hit what you need on the screen.

Pros:  low price, inexpensive, decent performance (3500 CPU mark which is comparable to an i3 5th or 6th generation), low power usage, dual monitor output, small size, 4 USB (3.0)

Cons: Slight noise from fans, can run hot, uses a bit more energy than i3 6th generation, F1 Bios the fans would occasionally go full blast and would be loud

The pc is mostly used for Plex but it also is used for browsing, etc.  I plugged this into a Kill A Watt for a week.  Idle it consumes about 14 watts and under a load, up to 41 watts.  For the week (watching a movie a night).....at current electricity rates (.13 kWh),  is costs less than 5 cents a day to run this 24x7.

I put an 8GB memory chip in and an 128GB mSata SSD drive. I left the 2.5"" bay open for future expansion.  I connected a 2 TB portable 2.5"" HD for media.

Performance is decent. CPU mark was 3500 [...]
I installed Windows 10 and it boots in about 8 seconds.  Using Plex, I have played four different movies at the same time (two TVs, one ipad, and one iphone).

I have not run the benchmark after upgrading the Bios to version F2 a few months ago.  I did notice that the fan never went full blast once I did.  When the fan did go full blast, it was very noisy so I recommend you update to F2.

A nice package if you don't need something totally silent.  If you do, check out the Intel based NUCs that cost at least $100 more.  The Gigabyte Brix, 8GB memory, and 128 SSD only cost me $236 shipped.  That is tremendous performance for the price!",5.0

I did integrated video, and it was stuck at one resolution. I put in my 630, same problem. It wasn't until early this morning that I remembered my Radeon. I am like ""if all else fails I can't say I didn't try."" WELL. To my surprise it fixed a lot of my issues.

One massive plug still overs up two outlets. Silly feature. And as other reviewers noted, this thing is laughably loose in the socket. There's no screw to hold it in place, so if you decide to unplug something, you have to use two hands. Not the biggest inconvenience in the world, but certainly a valid reason not to award this thing 5 stars.

13629588,Let me start by saying these headphones are beautiful. With stainless steel and leather these things look rugged and classy. I wear a 7.25 hat and the clamp of these phones lean towards  an over ear  sound vs. on ear but they're only comfortable for an hour or two. People with larger heads might not be comfortable wearing these. As far as sound goes they've handled everything I've thrown at them mostly being EDM and Rap. Acoustically these are awesome and there is no extortion when listening at max volume. Low end is also exceptional for this price range when cranked all the way up. My discrepancy is that I use these as commuters and at half volume unamped these suck. If you're going to use these hooked to your phone you WILL NEED A PORTABLE AMP. For someone like me that already carries two galaxies (one for work and one for play) this is quite cumbersome. It works when I'm snowboarding  but isn't practical walking around with. My real gripe is the bass. They sound pretty good at max volume but aren't to my particular taste at half to 3/4 volume.

I've had 2 of these, and within 20 hours of use both units had pixels start to die.  The pixels weren't dead out of the box, things were fine for the first few days, then they just started to die off on both units.  And these big televisions are a colossal hassle to repack and return, and that's if dead pixels are even covered at all (LG doesn't cover them).  You get what you pay for, I suppose.

It's not cutting edge technology, and won't hold up to the rigors of professional photojournalism, but it's small, lightweight, and give you a tremendous zoom range.

Pros:

a) Audio Quality - Nice

b) Vertical Scrolling pad - Awesome

c) Battery Life - Good

d) Plug point Charger and Wrapper comes with the package . Whereas in Ipods, thats not the case and you need to purchase them seperately.

e) Huge Memory of 20 GB

Cons:

a) Definitely heavier and bulkier than similar players in this category. When you consider travelling by public means, Ipod Nano gets a better mark here.

b) FM Radio is not in-built and you need to purchase a transmitter seperately.

c) Voice Recorder Feature is missing. Generally many creative players have FM and Voice Recorder facility in-built.

d) Maximum Volume can be higher. When travelling in noisy conditions, volume had to kept at 20+ when the max volume level is 25.

e) Player Shutdown feature is not user-friendly.

f) Battery indicator could have been given more levels. when it shows a single point, you never know whether it stands  for 2 hrs or 4 hrs or half an hour.

g) As you keep loading more and more songs, there is a clear delay time or lag during song retrieval .

h) Every thing has to be done thro the media organizer software installed in PC (Creating Playlists, editing artist data etc...). All that can be done in the player is to play/pause and scroll thro songs.

i) This is regarding Player compatibility with certain Operating System. In Many of the previous versions of Windows (Before XP), only Zen Touch's own driver works if you try connecting the player to PC. i have win 2000 and 98. Since i had misplaced the CD (driver for this player) ,tried with other creative drivers (from site,  from the driver CD given for Zen Micro , Mu-Vo etc.) But did not work.

11083046,"I own a 2013 Camry LE with a basic stereo. When I bought the car new, I opted out of the upgraded stereo with backup option because was $2000 more and was bundled with other options I would not use. I use my iPhone with a robust navigation app that included traffic updates and alternative routes and use an air conditioning grill mount which positions the camera higher in the dashboard. A GPS with traffic updates  and alternative routes is mandatory for driving around crowded Southern California freeways. I also bluetooth stream my music which mutes to low volume when directions are spoken over the stereo. I do not think that the external bluetooth stereo and internal Car GPS system will be as seamless in volume control. I read other backup camera reviews. Although it was abit more expensive than more generic backup camera systems, it was made made specifically for certain Toyota years when the same stereo system was installed. It plugs directly into your OEM stereo system without splicing wire behind the dashboard. This is the same backup camera mount system installed after market at the dealer which they will charge you a small fortune. Best price was at Amazon.com. I am not a DIY call stereo installer. Negotiated with a local stereo installer for $80 to mount. He was able to install the camera directly in the middle of the trunk right over the license plate. Views from the camera in reverse were excellent both day and night. Even in a pitch black I can see clearly behind me. Love the ability to backup in tight parking lots and get closer to cars and objects behind me using the grid on the screen and to see pedestrian. You still need to view your sides when using any backup camera system.",5.0
14943055,"After 400 miles with the Garmin Edge 520, it impresses as my first GPS unit.  But there are some issues, as other reviewers have pointed out.

Positives:
-Screen visible under all conditions
-Lack of touchscreen useful for 'dumb' gloves and dirty fingers
-Zero problems with sensors disconnecting, though they came pre-paired as part of the bundle
-Strava segment integration makes PRs a given - sort of cheating, really
-Battery only needs to be charged every 3-4 rides (12h vs. the marketed 'Up to 15h')

Negatives:
-Initially spotty bluetooth syncing with phone (Moto X 2014) - fixed by software updates.  Have you tried turning it off then on again?
-Under 50MB of storage!?  Sure the activity files are minuscule and it fits my basemap needs but this would be a deal-breaker for touring cyclists.
-Strava segment integration is clunky for a headline feature.  Required going on Garmin Connect's site to switch from their segments to Strava, then starring your segments on Strava before going back to Garmin and selecting which ones to enable.  At least they can be synced wirelessly.
-Strava Premium is required to use live segments; I ended up using other premium features beyond the free trial but disabled live segments so I suppose 'they got me'.
-Minor complaint but the buttons are very stiff and insensitive, especially with Garmin's silicone protector.  Good for durability, bad for use.

4/5 stars since for basic use (turn on, ride, wireless sync, turn off) the Edge 520 is very effective.  However be warned, most of the bonus features that made the 520 enticing over the 510 (or even 500) probably aren't worth it.  Think of it as commuting daily in a Ferrari.",4.0

14434359,"I walk every day and love to listen to music.  I have not had much luck with corded ear phones.  It seems I am always shorting one side out.  So I decided to come to the wireless side.  Here is my evaluation of this set of Dreaminex Bluetooth headphones:

PACKAGING - They come in a small box and includes the headphones, 6 sets of different size rubber ear pieces, three sets of rubber ear hooks. Everything was securely packaged and arrived in perfect condition.

APPEARANCE - They have a bright green cord and black ear pieces.  The cord between the ear pieces measures 21"".  They are long enough to wear under your chin or behind your neck.

COMFORT - The earpieces are angled, and have a flexible rubber ear hooks. They fit easily and securely into my ears. I have my left tragus (the little ear flap) pierced and often find it difficult for buds to stay in place. Buy using a smaller rubber ear piece, I was able to keep it in place comfortably.

INSTRUCTIONS - Complete instructional guide included complete with pictures.

BLUETOOTH PAIRING -  Hold the button down until the blue and red lights flash. The device is called ""ACTISOUND"". It literally took less than 30 seconds to sync with my iPhone 6.

CHARGING - I charged them for about 4 hours before using.  I have used them for about an hour a day for the past 3 days and they have not died yet.

SOUND - Sound quality is decent for both music and podcasts. The sounds are clear and static free.  Bass is not ""thumping"" but that's okay with me. While it sounds good to me, it is not as sharp or clear as my daughter's Beats.  Of course, they are about a quarter of the price of Beats so I can do without the bass.

CONTROLS - Volume +/- is controlled by a button on top of the right ear piece.  I did find it somewhat difficult to adjust the volume without taking the ear piece out.  It was easier for me to use my phone setting for that.

Overall, I have found nothing negative in my testing of this product and can give it 5 stars without hesitation.

6586387,"This keyboard cover gets four stars right off the bat because it's the best one I could find on amazon, and I've purchased a few. Here is why this cover is better than the alternatives:

PROS:
-Doesn't hinder backlight. Many keyboard covers block the back lighting of your macbook's keys. A keyboard cover should protect and enhance your keyboard, not take away valuable features.
-This one is completely clear, so the buttons will match, the caps lock light works, and the backlighting is still visible.
-The cover is thin

CONS:
-It really feels like you put a condom on your keyboard. It has been well documented that condoms make your experience feel worse. Other covers feel better, but don't function as well.
-The cover comes off somewhat easily, and leaves your buttons looking cloudy. It's not the slickest cover out there, but it doesn't ruin the features of your keyboard.

Overall: This is the best cover for a retina macbook (at least) you can find right now. It could feel better, and it could look better, but it doesn't make the deal-breaking errors other covers currently are.",4.0

Indeed, my cable modem (Motorola) has a diagnostic mode where it can display the strength of the incoming signal. I measured it on the old splitter, switched to the Monster - and see exactly zero difference.

Still, considering that my local electronics store no-name brand is about $15, I don't feel bad paying a few dollars more for the Monster product. It certainly seems more rugged, and I doubt I'd ever have to replace it again.

7793827,"At the moment (January 2013), the Poetic Revolution is the only Otterbox-style ruggedized protection for the Nexus 10.  I've contacted Otterbox who says that they don't currently have plans to manufacture a case for the N10, so I chose the Poetic case.

At first glance, it has many of the same features of the Otterbox Defender cases: three layers of protection, outer rubbery layer, built-in screen protector.  It appears as if it will afford the same level of protection, so I feel pretty good with my purchase.  It adds some bulk, but that's the way I like my devices.

-1 star because the outer rubbery layer definitely doesn't fit as secure as my Otterbox phone cases do.  It slips out of position where it mates with the hard case at the screen.  Since I won't be putting this thing in and out of my pocket, this may not be an issue.
-1 star because I'm also a little skeptical about whether the kickstands will hold up over time.  They're hard to get in and out and feel a little cheap versus the design of the case overall.

IMPORTANT UPDATE (5/10/2013):
-1 additional star - I had been having problems using video calling apps on my Nexus 10 tablet.  Tango, for example, was alsmost impossible to use because the microphone was cutting in and out while talking, and the audio received was very choppy (like an old, cheap speakerphone would work).  I initially thought it was my wifi connection, then I wondered if there was something wrong with the mic/speakers on the tablet.  I took the Nexus 10 out of the Poetic case and the sound quality immediately recovered.  I believe the case was compressing the tablet too hard around the microphone region, or otherwise blocking the microphone (or deflecting speaker output back in to the microphone) that was screwing up the audio send-receive process.

-1 additional star - I contacted Poetic about the issue on 4/30 and have yet to receive anything but a ""we received your message"" response.  If it were an Otterbox, they would have been back in touch with me in a day.  The tablet sits unprotected and the case is sitting in a drawer until they respond.

I was EXTREMELY disapointed when I realized that the ACTUAL data transfer rate will NEVER exceed about 60 MB/s.  I discovered that after being on hold with customer service for about 45 minutes.  As the member of tech support informed me, the transfer rate tops out at about 60MB/s.  However, that is ONLY if you are transferring files that are several gigabytes in size.  If you are transferring a bunch of small to medium sized files, you will get the crappy performance that I received, which equates to a data transfer rate of 3-12MB/s.  The 3GB/s, as stated by tech support, is only a THEORETICAL data transfer rate that MAY be available when solid state drives become available.

I had to contact support with some questions that I thought could have been better explained in the guide that came with the frame. In fairness, I am new to the cloud. I had to learn how to send pictures to the cloud. Next I had to create albums. Next I had to learn to publish albums. It seems that to add pictures to an album, first you have to unpublished the album, add the new picture(s), then republish the album. I also had to adjust the frame to display a high definition (720) picture. I thought that it was an option to load pictures with a disk or thumb drive. I was told that you can't do that because the pictures reside in the ""CLOUD"". The frame itself is reasonably heavy and balances back on a sturdy plastic ring. The motion sensor works very well when someone walks in the area. There are settings to determine how long the frame displays pictures when no motion is detected. You set a clock on the frame in setup. You can set times during the day when the frame can begin displaying pictures and a time when the frame sleeps and motion should not turn it on. I have mine set to sleep from 10 pm till 7 am, but I sometimes find the frame displaying pictures at 11:30 pm or later.

I'm pretty sure the 10-foot Belkin cable I received through Amazon Vine is the real thing. The cable is made with a heavy duty super thick vinyl or plastic housing. It works without a hitch and doesn't twist or tangle. I purposely didn't review it right away because I wanted to make sure it lasted a few weeks after reading the other reviews. I have other Belkin lightening cables, some for a few years, and they all still work flawlessly. This 10-foot model is perfect for when you need a longer length of cable, like when there's no outlet near your desk or table. Or even in a hotel room when you really have limited outlet real estate.\

It is well constructed. The bulk is hard plastic, with an aluminum mesh wrap, which is secured by around 20 screws. It feels good in your hand and the Meidong is just over 7 inches long.

Under the top is the majority of what makes this tick: Bluetooth, play/pause, volume, track advance, and NFC.  I will say, it is much easier to control through your phone/device.  The speaker buttons take a little bit of pressure to bring to life. For me, the play/pause didn't work with my streaming music and it auto-dialed the last phone number every time I try. It may be different for you. I'm on an iPhone6.

The sound is on par for the price. It is a little top-heavy on the playback. Oddly enough, if you turn it around it sounds much better (speakers away from you). It looks good for sure.

At the price point - I'd put this around 4 Stars.  The fact that the play/pause button launches my phone dialer - 3 Stars.  The play/pause on my device works perfectly fine.

I will err on the side of Meidong about the button, but beware if you have an iPhone6!

Overall, I'd rate this between 3.5-4 Stars.

Seven hours of playback is nice, but you can also plug it in through mUSB. You can also opt to plug in directly to your device as both cables are included.

I booted it up and charged it, which took about 6 hrs (I later found out charging depends on which USB port you use). Then I tried to update the firmware, which failed repeatedly. It also disconnected all the time when I tried to copy files to it. I called support, which took over 30 min to have a live person. It turned out I shouldn't be using the USB port from the monitor. Instead, one should be using the ones directly off the computer. No other USB devices had this problem.

Now it comes to copying files, videos and photo. It's soooo inconvenient! You have to use ""Sansa Media Converter"", which doesn't show what you have on the device and you have to type in the folder name, instead of browsing what's on the device. Every time you want to see what's already on the device, you'd have to unplug the cable and browse on the device. For photos, it only shows in Portrait. If you want to show Landscape, you'd have to convert the photo BEFORE storing on the device.

Video playback is not reliable (with the latest firmware 1.02.15). For the same pieces, it sometimes plays fine but causes hanging & reboots of the device other times. Half of the pieces I copied to the device hiss at words with ""s"". The hiss is apparently related to conversion from MPEG (.mpg) to QuickTime Movie (.mov), using Sansa Media Converter. I copied the converted files back to my PC and they had the same hiss using QuickTime player or iTune. No conversions required with MP3 files and no problems there.

All in all, it feels like a device lack of basic professional software support as expected these days. As a result, while I bought it for its video & photo features, I might end up using it mostly for MP3 playing, which is quite good. It's twice as thick and heavy as a Nano.

2467602,"I was quite intrigued by the paper specifications and the other positive reviews. I used the lens on a Nikon D90 body and tried out some bird photography in late afternoon light. The lens build quality looks terrific and it has a very nice hood and case. Some of the problems I ran into were quality related and some just an artifact of a slow long lens. Auto-Focusing is reasonably fast. I got a lot of softness shooting the lens wide open (f6.3) at 500mm. You have to be very careful with focusing since the depth of field is extremely shallow (it's easy to misfocus on something ahead or behind the subject). The sharpness improved as I moved the aperture down to f/8 and smaller.

I also tried it with the OS (Optical Stabilization) Off (on a tripod) and On. For me personally, hand-holding below 1/200 seemed iffy. The OS was also very noisy and sounded unusual in that it was uneven. Further the unit continued to be noisy even after focus had been achieved and the shutter was half squeezed which I wasn't expecting. It takes a while to get used to the OS which seems to be different from Nikon. It takes a bit longer to kick in and you have to wait for this. This is probably something that takes a few days to pick up.

I've returned the lens since. I'm still intrigued enough to want to try out another one in case the problems I had were specific to the unit I had.

Bottom line, the lens build quality seems great and autofocusing is good. Expect some softness if you shoot wide open and long. You do have to make compromises getting a lens of this focal length at this price. The compromise is that most of your shooting will have to be on sunny days or with the ISO bumped up on cloudy days so you can shoot with smaller apertures and faster shutter speeds.

  This came very highly recommended from my geek squad friends.  I originally purchase this a while back, unfortunately I had to return the first one due to one of the two fans just stopped working at all after only 30 days.  I contacted Amazon and they made everything acceptable very quickly.  They shipped me a return label that I could print in my email and let me know it would be about three weeks before I'd get the new replacement.  To my surprise the following day I received a second email letting me know Amazon has shipped my item and I should be receiving it within only a few days.  I love the new cooler and it has been working hard now for over a month.  Thank you Amazon, way to keep a good customer coming back...!!!!  I'll definitely purchase again from this vendor - they know how to keep a customer satisfied.

The center wheel is smooth in operations, and all button presses/clicks have a good tactile feel to them unlike some low end mice.

I had it at my nightstand, never moved it or travelled with it, and now it has some sort of short in which I have to wiggle it around to get it to charge. The cord that came with my phone from Apple, although very short, goes with me in my car and to work and has never had a problem and is two years old. The description when I bought this cord said ""certified."" I highly doubt it. What a waste of money.",1.0
14645064,excellent sound. comes with 6 different types of rubber earpieces. cord seems strong and mic works well. does not have volume up or down for iphone. since it seals off the ear and the cord is covered by nylon you get an effect similar to using a stethoscope ( you can hear it loudly when the cord brushes aginst your face or clothing). the cord from the two earbuds meet a couple feet from the earbuds which is too low and there's no piece sliding up and down allowing you to shorten the gap. the clip meant to clip the mic to your clothes is also too low (whereas which an earbud like the one that comes with apple products it hangs perfectly below your chin). mic clip can be used to shorten the gap between where the earbud cords meet.,3.0

6170146,"Ok the keyboard its not perfect, but why 5 stars then? Well beacuase the keyboard is well design, plus its waterproof and the battery last long long long time. I have realy big hands, but relative skinny fingers so for me its easy to type. Plus it have a camara hole so you can take pictures and take notes while been in class.

So now the cons. I wish it could have a diference way to support the tablet, but the good side is that if you don't like the case, you could detach the keyboard really carefully and place it on a homebrew case for more comfy. It takes a time to get use to the keyboard. Well the keyboard response pretty well, just a little delay, less dan halfsecond.

I won't tell you to ignore the hate and rage reviews because for some people I can see this keyboard could be a nightmare, maybe if you have enourmous hands, or if you don't like the keyboard material, or the little delay in tipping response.

For me, this is a pretty good keyboard, and the price its exelent. I got to admit I was a little scary to order it for the badreviews but once I try it, I know that those little cons, I don't care. Well hope this review help you.",5.0
6862442,"First, let me get the pros / cons out:
Pros:
Great screen, bright, clear, easy to use
Nice keyboard with logical layout
Has USB ports both USB 3.0 (1) and USB 2 (1)
Plenty of memory, fast storage, and slim profile
Great battery life (6+ hours)
Cons:
Only 2 USB ports and the USB 3.0 seems to have a power issue - it drops devices periodically
No Ethernet - so you use wireless or grab one of the 2 USB ports for Ethernet
Screen wants to dim even if you turn off that function
Touchpad - let's call it a Touchbad - it's an abomination and all but useless

Overall, this is the best Ultrabook I have worked with.  I really like the form factor, cool running (it never seems to overheat) and fast storage.  I frequently have to copy data to USB and/or CDROM so issues with the USB 3 port dropping devices is irritating. I also find the touchpad irritating beyond words.  Suffice it to say within hours of trying to use it 1. I was driving my blood pressure over the line and 2. it was ""marred"" just from skin oils, and could not be clean.
Manufacturers, what is wrong with putting a good, high-quality pad on these devices?  Do you put sadists in that part of engineering?  And please, put an Ethernet port on ALL notebooks.  Please.
So, one needs to use a mouse with it. Either use a Bluetooth (the HP 4000b is the best) or a ""wireless"" - but the Bluetooth ones just are not as sensitive or smooth as the wireless, so there goes 50% of the available ports!
What gives it 4 stars are style (not embarrassing to use) light weight, power, screen, keyboard, and battery life.  Once you get a real mouse, and Ethernet adapter on it, it's a great office machine / road machine / bring your own device machine.
Recommended.
Oh, Dell - fix the touchbad, put another USB and an Ethernet port on it, will you?",4.0

It took me only a few minutes and was really straightforward. Im impressed that this installed without any bubbles or dust.

I like the FM stereo light that comes on when you have a strong signal as it helps me to know I've hit the sweet spot and the signal doesn't fade in and out.

I thought oh well I could just find another charger or buy one pretty cheap from amazon and the band fit me, so it wasn`t going to be a problem for me.

I am a professional photographer in Virginia and have been slowly building up my camera equipment. I am also a minimalist so I don't always believe you have to have the fanciest camera to get those amazing shots. All you need is a sturdy body and a good lens.
This lens was exactly what I wanted. I needed something to go from wide to zoom without me having to change lenses. When I'm doing a wedding I don't always have time to do that.
(So far) The photos I've taken are crisp and bright. I've barely had to do any editing with contrast or color or anything. I'm really thrilled with the quality.

This week it has begun typing the letter J on more often than it should. I thought maybe I was just accidentally hitting it, but it happened far too frequently and when I actually did press it I would get a string of jjjjjjjjjjjs.

2803935,"I agonized over getting a top tier detector but sort of convinced myself that I could make do with this mid-range priced unit.  That was a mistake.  The Whistler works as claimed, to a point.  And that point is way too short as I'll explain.  After setting it up and putting it in service, the unit alerted like crazy around security alarms.  I re-programmed to eliminate the common X band but it still lit up and announced all the K and Ka band security systems in various stores as I passed them which proved annoying and began to desensitize me toward legit law enforcement alarms.

A few days later the unit shouted out ""Ka Band"" a couple of times as I traveled a back highway but way too late.  A cop car had me scanned-sealed-delivered with the Whistler providing only about a 25 yard warning window.  That one, luckily, got me only a warning ticket.  Next was another too brief a warning time for a cop using a laser gun from a roadside clump of bushes.  I was literally on top of him when my warning of ""Laser"" yelped out with the attendant blinking lights from the Whistler.  Fortunately, for me, the guy in front of my vehicle got pulled over for a ticket while I was able to continue down the road.

That did it for me.  I retired the Whistler and ponied up some $400+ for a Bel GX-65 which, so far, has been impressive.  Put this one down to the old adage of, ""You get what you pay for"" and in my case and this Whistler, not nearly close to providing genuine value.",2.0

4890618,"I've spent the last two weeks looking for a case for my iPad2. I went to several stores as well as shopping online, reading reviews, articles, etc. I was shocked to see how many iPad2 cases are on the market. Anyway here's what I was looking for:

1. A case that would protect the front and back from scratches, allow for carrying in briefcase and maybe even a minor accident.
2. A case that supported the new sleep mode on iPad 2 where simple magnets can put it to sleep when closed or wake it up when opened.
3. Something that looked professional or at least decent, I'm not terribly picky about the aesthetics but it can't be pink with big flowers on it either.
4. I wanted a case that would allow me to set it an angle ideal for typing and also for watching movies.
5. I really didn't want to spend over $50
6. I wanted something that didn't add a lot of bulk to the iPad2. One of the things I like best about the iPad2 is it's size/weight and I didn't want a bulky or heavy case.

That seemed pretty simple to me and I thought it would be easy to find but surprisingly that combination isn't terribly common among the hundreds of cases I came across. After a fair amount of online study and shopping at local stores I ordered the Bear Motion case from Amazon. I chose the brown one just because there are hundreds of black ones and this was a little different. I received it today and am really impressed. It meets all of my requirements and it fits perfectly. Plus it looks really nice, the images on Amazon don't do it justice. You open the package and you get the new leather smell and it looks, feels, smells like real quality leather. I'm shocked that the price is as low as it is.

4794873,"I've only owned the TV for two days now, so keep in mind that these are my first impressions.

Negatives:
-There is a noticeable buzzing, I'll talk about that below in depth

Positives:
+Amazing picture quality, best picture I've personally ever seen. Having used LCDs for many years now, I feel like it's the first time I'm actually seeing true black on a TV.
+Tons of nice features (wifi, samsung apps, very nice remote)
+Beautifully designed, very sleek and slim

I bought the TV through Paul's and it was shipped via Pilot Freight. TV shipped out very quickly, and Pilot did an excellent job with delivery. I was able to simply schedule a delivery date/time online (after TV had shipped). TV came in perfect condition, with a mfg date of December 2011. All around great service from amazon, pauls, and pilot. Hats off, delivering a 59'' plasma across the country is no easy task.

Now onto the buzzing. First, let me state that this is not a huge issue at all. I have very acute hearing, and I barely noticed it. Other people in the room haven't noticed it at all. I discovered that the noise was very directional. I could hear it in one seat, and just one foot to the left it was silent. Note that this is while the TV was muted. With the TV on, I can only hear it during commercial changes. The noise itself also seems to vary based on the color the TV is displaying (pure whites and blacks result in the loudest buzz). Overall, a very minute issue. It seems like the longer the TV is on, the quieter the buzz gets. Regardless, in a few days the surround sound will be installed and this noise will be a thing of the past.

Hands down the best TV I have ever used. I would recommend it to anyone looking for the best picture quality they can get (for the price). Be prepared to change your perception of what TV watching should be.

I was also able to pair other devices successfully (3 devices paired). Fit was good after trying other size ear pieces. I thought smaller would fit better in the ear canal but found my music to be flat. I then switched to a bigger bud and felt the music sounded better and fuller with more bass.

The Bad: Back to the volume control, the volume doesn't seem to override the level set on the phone.

We recently bought a 4th camera, but can't use it because the app doesn't recognize it - we get the error message ""The camera has been added by its owner. Please contact the owner to share the camera with you"" when trying to add the camera. Visited Tenvis tech support site, which says:

If your camera is a brand new but app New Tenvis says this camera has already been added by others, you can send us an email support@tenvis.com with problem description, UID number and picture of label at the bottom so that we can delete your camera's UID from others' New Tenvis account in our database. The reason why your brand new camera's UID is added by others is some distributors may test camera before they sold out. Therefore, they may use their New Tenvis account add your camera's UID number to test.

We followed these instructions and Tenvis replied:

After checking the camera UID [number from bottom of camera], we found that the UID for this camera can not be recognized by our system. Your camera maybe purchasing from somes unauthorized sellers in USA, please send the camera back to Amazon seller.

So apparently the camera we were sold is either used or was ""tested"" before it was sold, but for whatever reason the UID is not registered with Tenvis and the camera can't be reset, meaning we can't get the app to recognize it, so it's useless.

We're returning for a refund and will purchase another one, but will be sure to confirm we're dealing with an authorized seller (the one that sold us this camera isn't - according to the Tenvis site, the only U.S. seller authorized to sell on Amazon is Ecasa Zone).",4.0

One issue I had was that the rewind, pause, fast-forward, and play buttons on the remote didn't work right. I'd go to rewind and it would fast forward. I'd hit pause and it would rewind. And so on. The buttons on the remote are SUPER sensitive - sometimes the back button would take you back two or three screens at once. Annoying but not the end of the world.

Then last night the Roku froze while I was loading a movie. I followed the instructions to reset the box. No good... the box stopped talking to the TV.

The seller was great. They shipped it immediately and it arrived two days early, so I was able to use it as my carry-on for my trip.

18733720,"This device came with ICS 4.0x on it which had some software bugs. Also the internal memory will fill up very quickly unless you do quite a few steps to upgrade this item. Here's my brief upgrade path:

(disclaimer: I am not responsible for bricking your device! This information is provided as a courtesy only!)

I chose the Feiyu rom over the cyanogenmod9 rom because of the supportbase.

Using the Feiyu ICS 4.0.3 rom mod as the base, I started at build 0322-v2, to build 0429-v1, to the conrom-v2 mod which is based off of the Feiyu ICS 4.0.3 0515 build.

Definately, the device must be rooted and clockworkmod version 5.x must be installed prior to changing the rom(s).

The first rom build (0322-v2) was flashed using the lifesuit version 1.07 utility. The subsequent 2 roms were flashed using clockworkmod.

I then used the free android utility called Link2SD, to use part of the sdcard as 'virtual internal memory'. I had to modify a file called install-recovery.sh, which Link2SD installed so that the first partition on sdcard would be used by the system. Now the virtual memory is shared with the real internal memory, giving me a total of 6gigs internal memory.

But you'll need to be patient -- this computer is SLOW.  Even after removing all the bloatware, this is far from being fast.  And if you had a mindset to do just basic upgrades (like adding a dedicated graphics card and psu) you will run into issues.  Even though there's a PCIe x16 slot, it's virtually useless with the provided power supply (180W is what mine came with; I see others got a 280W).  You might think ""I'll just upgrade the psu"" but that's when you realize Lenovo pulled a fast one on the consumer.  They use a proprietary 14-pin mobo power connection, which means every aftermarket power supply is useless.  There's a solution out there in the form of a 20+4 to 14 pin converter (find it on moddiy.com), but there is conflicting information on the wisdom of making this modification.  So I'm giving 2 stars for the simple fact Lenovo markets a cheaply built PC with expansion slots, but makes no mention of that fact you can't really use 'em without either buying their own psu (450W for a ridiculous $200) or getting creative in altering larger aftermarket psu's by either converters or using your re-wiring skills (which I ain't got).",2.0

Every time I have to take the cover on or off, I wish it was hinged to make it quicker and not have to do something with it.  Finally, the silicone skin is very soft, it not only gathers lint on it, but I worry that the unsupported edges at the top and bottom will sag and stretch over time.

Unfortunately, I must've gotten one of the bad ones - the screen had constant static color noises in the entire screen, and they were pretty noticeable against certain background colors (e.g., Skype's sky bluish color).  I could not read a pdf (one of the primary reasons for buying the tablet) because these color jitters were constantly moving in the background.  After a few hours of checking out the features, the tablet froze and I had to do a hard factory reset as a normal reset would not make it bootable again. The tablet started making a strange noise when booting up, like electric components starting.

After getting one-- its better than just that.  The camera is truly a compilation of all the technology that Sony has developed to date as well as an advancement.  Its fast, has more responsive autofocus and exposure than previous models (I've owned both the V1 and the S85).  The color of the new 4 color CCD is impressive-- and it generally makes things look great.  As for overall image quality-- so far so good.  I've had good luck with both natural light and using the flash.  The only time you'll probably really notice that you're using a digital camera is in the dark-- when the image can get a bit powdery... like digital grain.  Then again-- there are so many tools present in the camera you can use to make your dark lighting situations  brighter-- that you may never have the opportunity to experiment without those in low light like I like to.",5.0

However, when I tried to switch it to wireless connection, the disaster began.  I started with WPS connection, the device couldn't detect the router.  Then I changed to the manual connection, the software couldn't find my network.  I had to start over several times and it seems that I was able to connect it completely out of luck, meaning, even as a technology wizard (that's what people call me), I couldn't figure out why the previous times it didn't work and why now it works.  So I can't help anyone who have the same problem with a specific method to get it connected.  You just have to try it several time using several ways, including deleting the device from MyDLink account and starting over.

Now it's connected.  I want to try email alert, so I tried to set it up.  It was a clumsy process, but when I click Save to save the change, it tells me that the wireless network name and password cannot be empty.  The network name field doesn't allow me to enter anything and it's not showing the currently connected network.  The camera is already working on the network, but the network name field is empty and since it is empty, MyDLink.com asks me to enter the information, or I wouldn't be able to save any changes.  But IT DOESN'T ALLOW ME TO ENTER ANYTHING, or choose from a list.  I tested with FireFox, IE, and Chrome, but they all showed the same problem.

It's a nice camera with great pictures, even though the lens angle could be wider to cover more area.  But DLink failed on the software part.

15629914,"I've never had a ""smartwatch"" before, so I can't exactly make comparisons, but I will give my thoughts.

Battery life is not a mere two days, despite how much complaining goes on. I disabled the motion sensor, and the ambient sensor, feeling that if it's dark and I need to see the time, I'll just hit the button. This added a couple days to my battery life.

I get about 4 to 5 days until I hit 10-20%. I don't get an abundance of notifications. More like 10/day. The reply to text via voice works fairly well, with only a couple times not hearing what I was saying (loud environment). The music feature to me, is basically worthless. I'm sure it would be better if your phone was sitting away from you playing the music, but really, how hard is it to walk 20 feet to your phone to change the song?

With the backlight on, the screen colors are definitely washed out, but as you shouldn't be using the light for around-the-clock visibility, it really isn't a problem.

I love some of the watch faces. Though a few of them don't update the weather properly, which is annoying. There really aren't any apps that interest me, so I don't have any experience there.

As for the 4 star, rather than 5, I took it off for a couple reasons. I really like the 12, 3, 6, and 9 on the smaller band version, which isn't available on the bigger band version. Why is this?!? Stupid. Also, the included ""leather"" band does not feel like real leather at all. My wrist needs a setting between two of the pre-determined holes. It's just a cheap feeling band.

Some people might go so far as to say they forgot how to MAKE a quality product, With this in mind, I really didn't want to buy a Sony brand player. I decided to give it a try because it seemed to be the only one with the features I wanted at a reasonable price. I have to admit that I have been mostly impressed with this unit. From my point of view, the remote is the most disappointing. The button labels have such small writing that it is difficult to read in dim lighting. I watch most of my movies in dim to no lighting. A back lit remote would greatly improve the functionality of the remote.
The designers of the player definitely were concerned with looks more so than functionality. Instead of being flat on top it comes to a raised point on one side. This means whatever you put on top of it will not be level. GREAT THINKING SONY. Who knows, maybe Sony wanted to be sure that their player is always on top. The two biggest reasons I got a new player is I wanted it to have built in wi-fi and I wanted to stream videos from Amazon Prime.. The wi-fi worked perfect. Entering my password was cumbersome but I consider that minor. The Amazon Prime interface is awful. Not poor or confusing, just downright awful at least compared to Netflix. I don't know if this is the fault of Sony or Amazon so I won't say anything else about it.

Everything else about the player I have no complaints about and quite a few compliments. Much quicker DVD load time than my previous player and a great picture.

2882628,"I got this because I wanted to do some macro photography but didn't want to buy a lens just for macro since any lens these days is so expensive (and I'm in medical school with student loans to the moon and back).  For just ten bucks this simple little piece does the trick for what I need it to do.  The images I've gotten so far are fairly high quality macro, not quite on the level of what a dedicated macro lens would capture but also not that far off either.  Here's two images I got #1 (http://i.imgur.com/fUqwb6y.jpg) and #2 (http://i.imgur.com/NTyLKD2.jpg) using my Nikon ""kit"" lens that is 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6.

The only real limitation to this reverse adapter is that you have to manually do the aperture to get a good image, and by ""manually"" I don't mean only putting the camera in manual mode but also manually opening the aperture control lever with your finger or something else.  The lenses I own have an aperture that has a spring inside of it so that it closes when the lens isn't mounted on the camera body, so when you flip the lens around and go to shoot macro the aperture is closed as far as it will go and there's not even close to enough light to get a decent picture.  My Neanderthal way of fixing that was to wad up a little piece of paper and jam open the lever that controls the aperture, and although that's probably not the best thing to do to your lens I was very careful with it and it worked for me.  Only problem with that method is that the depth of field becomes almost nothing when you jam the aperture open all the way.  I know if I buy the aperture control adapter piece my problems will be solved, I just haven't gotten around to it yet.  If that paragraph didn't make any sense to you, wait a while to buy this piece because you need to have at least a decent grasp of photography terms and methods to effectively take reverse macro pictures.

Overall, a great product for the price and would highly recommend it for anybody wanting to try out some macro photography but not wanting to spend a fortune on a dedicated macro lens.",4.0

After reading the review in Baby Bargains which panned Koala Baby linens, I was sort of sorry that I had bought this bedding set.  However I can vouch that in this case, Baby Bargains was dead wrong.  The bedding is of good quality fabric (except the sheet isn't 100% cotton).  The appliques are sewn on (not stamped) and the fabric is very soft for baby's skin.  We were originally looking at the Delmar dolphin set for our son, but it seemed too ""loud"" and the fabric was a scratchier. When I did the ""cheek test"" in the store (brushed the fabric of the bedding against my cheek to check softness) this one was just perfect.  I'd have given it five stars but the fact that we haven't baby-tested it yet and also the cotton sheet thing and only having ties on top the bumper were drawbacks.

I chose the Pentax as a back up to the A2, as the Z-1 was too bulky to serve as a secondary camera while traveling.  It also used SD cards and AA rechargeables, which I have a bunch of.

Picture resolution is outstanding, and I have found no major problems with either the autofocus or exposure systems.  Picture quality is actually quite close to the Z-1.  Using a 1gb SD card, you have about 500 shots available at the highest resolution settings, more than enough to keep anyone busy.  This set-up, with a spare set of AA rechargeables (get the 2500 ones) was quite comfortable in a small case on my belt, serving as the back up to my A2.

This camera is also a good choice for back packers, as it is very light and batteries last quite long, limiting the need to carry too many spares.  If you get rechargeable lithium CR-V3s, they are actually lighter and last even longer.  Alas, this quality caused the loss of this dear little camera, as my girlfriend cast her eye on it and it ended up in her backpack.  To make her feel better about it (like I really needed to) I took her Sony DSC-P1 in exchange as my new spare...a real brick compared to the Pentax, and uses proprietary batteries which I hate.  Yes yes yes, I know the Minolta A2 uses a proprietary battery, but it is sooooo good that I bit the bullet.

Another viable alternative to this unit is the new Canon A510, which I may get.  Uses AAs and SD cards too, and also takes great pics.  The Sony will likely end up on Ebay.  I hate Memory Sticks too.  Slow and expensive.

Of course it's not infinite position, but it makes for a sturdier case rather than trying to incorporate the built-in stand.

My only issue with this case is it doesn't like my tempered glass screen protector.  It peels up easily on the top right corner if pressure is applied toward the device or away from the screen.  My pen loop on my back lit keyboard is on the left side, so I place this in my bag right side down.  Almost every time I take out my surface, I have to press down the top corner to re-seat my screen protector.  I wouldn't care so much if dust didn't exist, but little specs make their way in each time.  A dust spec has creeped in on the top left when I was testing the threshold of how much pressure it would take to peel up that corner.

I suppose if you want a security system for a small house or apartment with a land line, it might be okay, but I really can't testify to that.  As it happens I don't have a land line in my weekend home, where I would sensibly want to set this up, and anyway, I couldn't get the motion sensor to work.

The documentation is really confusing.  Panasonic seems most concerned about their legal liability in selling a security system and less interested in providing simple, clear setup instructions.  The basic setup is similar to hooking up an Amazon Echo to your local network, except that the Echo is much, much easier.  With the recently announced support for WEMO devices with the Echo, I would much rather invest in hardware for that system than buy this Panasonic product.

I'm a huge fan of Panasonic products - we even own Panasonic bicycles - and I've had a Panasonic webcam running in my weekend home for several years - it works well enough but I never did manage to get it to actually work wirelessly (it is wired to my router) and thus never did decide to buy more of them (I would have if I could figure out how to get it to work wirelessly).  This new product has its own wireless hub to control all the devices, which is a good thing - I was able to get the wireless socket outlet and door/window sensors to work, so I think if I had the cameras, they should work wirelessly, but as I mentioned I simply couldn't get the motion sensor to sense anything.

The bad thing with this drive is that it appears to be mac compatible at first (you can format it for OSX, and it appears to work fine at first).

I've come to the conclusion, after fiddling with this drive for a couple of months, that it should absolutely not be used with macs. While connected, it will go to sleep and be unresponsive. The mac cannot wake it (so can't eject it). Annoying. If you shut down the computer (no other choice), eventually the partition gets corrupted. I can make it work by plugging it in, immediately reading/writing to it, then ejecting it. But if it goes to sleep while you are working, you're stuck.

Booting into the BIOS (which is easy enough to navigate with a keyboard), I discovered I installed the drives in the wrong desired order (I had my boot drive on SATA 2 instead of SATA 0).

Shuffling the drives around took less than 5 minutes, since they were all in the sleds that could be loaded into any slot easily.

This is a great little device as long as you remember two things.
1.  It likes to occupy the higher drive letters (like ""d"", ""e"", ""f"", & ""g"").  I had quite a few mapped drives that occupied those spots, and had to move them to lower letters for the device to show up.

It shows that it deleted the data very quickly off of windows Explorer, but it's actually taking a little longer to complete the deletion off of the card.

Card was not detected whatsoever by the motherboard. I took this as far as to mean the motherboard wasn't reading the PCI-E slot properly. This resulted in me attempting to reflash the board with a new BIOS revision (and ultimately bricking and having to RMA it; this is a tragedy better left for another story).

When I got a new motherboard, I tried the card again...and still no results. The card is fine (will show up during the boot cycle on another machine) and the motherboard's PCI-E slot is fine (read a PCI-E x1 Intel Gigabit Ethernet card), so it's literally down to the combination of this card and that motherboard.

Pros:
*Wireless, of course.
*Seems lightweight, after use for about 5 hours straight (again I've never owned a headset).
*Seems as if it has good bass and sound quality with the WIRELESS ADAPTER (again I've never owned a headset so).
*Charged for approximately 4/5 hours while using the device, took off charge, and its worked for another 10 hours at least so far without dying.

Cons:
*Originally going to use this headset to Bluetooth with my phone, to use TeamSpeak. If you are doing to do the same, do NOT purchase this.
*The left earpiece for me touches the top of my ear, so it starts to hurt after a while (again never owned a headset).
*Wireless range is definitely not all its cracked up to be. Walked approximately 20-25 feet to my refrigerator which would require the wireless transmitter to go through one wall and it started to crackle.

All pros and cons stated above are legit, stuff that actually happened while using this headset.

This radio was easy to use, picked up my favorite station, and was a convenient size. There are several versions of this radio, and some of them have an antenna and some do not.  This particular version appears to have a thin wire that is attached to the wrist strap that helps with reception.  Without an antenna, this radio is only going to pick up the strongest stations nearby.  It has the ability to play music from a micro sd card or a USB (some versions of this radio only use micro SD cards--no USB option).  I like that this radio is small enough to put in a pocket and take with me.  It would be great for playing music near a pool or taking camping or on a picnic.  It is a great choice to take places that you wouldn't want to take more expensive electronics.  I move it around the house to play music while working, instead of streaming music on a tablet or using my stereo.  The pretty color is another plus.  It uses a rechargeable battery that is charged with a mini USB cord (like the kind that used to charge the old Blackberry phones).  The charge has lasted a reasonable amount of time.

A few things to be aware of and why I only gave it 3 stars.
*) Power cord could be longer. It's a AC cord/power-block/DC cord setup with a overall length of ~6'. OK for most but I use the monitor on a roll about stand and would prefer a short AC cord with a long DC cord so the power-block isn't getting dragged all over the place.
*) No height or swivel adjustment, just back tilt (no forward tilt).
*) The combo HDMI/MHL input seems to be limited to 30Hz, I'm using the regular HDMI at 60Hz, haven't tried the Display Port
*) The settings menu buttons are under the front lip and not easy to use. Not a big issue since once set I have no reason to touch them anymore.
*) The built-in speakers are TERRIBLE. The sound quality sounds like a vintage 1970 pocket transistor radio at best. They also are on the back which destroys the stereo affect.

I don't know yet if the built-in amp will be enough (through the headphone jack) when matched with the powered speakers I'm waiting on (Logitech Z200).

Pros:
MUCH more comfortable than my old headphones, I can wear these for HOURS without discomfort
very little microphonics
Sound quality is good - Im not good with music terms so I'll leave it at that, maybe headfi has some reviews by now or you can read the
  the other review by Adam, in contrast though I'm not a bass head so I think these are fine as is.
comes with foam ear tips - first time I've ever had any of those, the sealing on them is GODLIKE

Cons:
right angle sound jack - it catches on my pants pocket when I slide my phone into my pocket and unplugs the earbuds, it also has like a longer segment where the 3.5mm jack is so it fits phones with cases better, so if you have a case you should not have this problem
No bump to feel for the left or right side - You have to look at them to see which goes into which ear.

May 4, 2017 UPDATE
I used these daily for close to a year up until I lost them. Eventually you get the hang of which earbud goes in which ear by just looking at them. You also get used to the right angled jack, though I still don't like them. During the year I had with these, they held up pretty well, no repairs were needed and nothing broke. I'd definitely recommend these to anyone looking to get a new pair of earbuds, I'm thinking about getting a replacement pair too xD

It holds your iPhone 3G securely.  I've been using this for over a year with my iPhone 3G until I accidentally took it swimming with me.  I bought an iPHone 4 as a replacement and found that it would not fit any of the 3 cradles that come with this.  I found that it worked perfect if I removed the cradle all together, but was woried that without the support of the cradle that it would eventually damage my iPhone case.

When travelling, I take this with me for my car rental.  I also take a short 12"" stereo cable with me in case the rental has an AUX port.  The charger has a stereo out port at the base and, using the AUX port will always sound better than FM transmitter.

15185934,"This iBeek Bluetooth Receiver is an easy-to-use, efficiently designed Bluetooth-based receiver that allows you to play your music over your car stereo system as long your car has a power port (aka cigarette lighter) and your car's stereo has an 3.5mm Aux input port.

It essentially turns your car's system into a big Bluetooth jukebox, and it works well... once you figure a couple things out. This can connect via NFC too, though we did not try that out is this testing opportunity.

We tested this on our 1998 Jeep: The sound system in that Jeep is not OEM -- it is a later model Sony that does have an Aux port -- so we just plugged this device into the cigarette lighter (which is just below the radio in the Jeep), plugged the 3.5mm cable into the stereo's Aux port, synced the unit with my HTC Driod DNA and hit the road listening to Pandora.

One thing to note if your sound is fainter than you would like, especially with calls, is that the device has its own volume control... the forward and revers track controls also double as volume controls too. Yes, it takes a bit to get used to using this device.  Another thing to mention is that the USB port on the power adapter part of this unit actually had a good rate of flow and charged my HTC Droid DNA quicker than our typical 1A wall adapter.

You will need to make a choice of where you would like this unit's magnetic base adhered to your dashboard (via supplied two-way 3M sticky adhesive pad); plan carefully, away from window, vent and HVAC noise sources.

If you have a car stereo that is not Bluetooth enabled but does have a 3.5mm Aux port, and if you are are looking for a Bluetooth music streaming option of this size, style, price, and technology, for use similar to what I have described above, then we recommend giving this iBeek Bluetooth Receiver unit a try based on our experience with it.

10950266,"This is a replacement for a well traveled graphite Big Jambox left behind on vacation.  It was banged up and dented with paint over-spray but the thing still rocked just as hard as when it was new.  I wanted something with more visual impact so it wouldn't get left behind again.

At first it sounded a little shrill, very tight and lacking in bass.  Remember that ALL new amplifiers and speakers like to be broken in.  I ran it for 2 hours on Tidal at high volume and noticed a definite improvement in frequency response and sound quality.  I was really surprised to hear it report ""Battery is close to full"" after close to 2 hours of high volume use.  Given enough privacy I like music so loud you can FEEL it and even I forgot just how loud the Big Jambox really is.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TRICK- Go ahead and laugh, then try it and hear for yourself.....

Although this works with almost any speaker, the Big Jambox is so bloody powerful it'll take great advantage of just about anything that resonates.  Place it angled away from a wall or with the speaker corner against and angled away from a wall or in the corner (angled at 45 degrees) of a bookshelf or just inside the cavity.  If you've never done this you'll be floored.  Slowly move it at different angles into and just out of any corner or try different angles against a wall or parallel to a wall (not flat back against the wall, it won't have enough air to bounce around) or inside different enclosed spaces, at any volume and you'll instantly hear what I mean.  I've even used empty hotel trashcans, sinks and larger flower pots as resonators with the Jambox inside facing out. Get it just right and the effect is epic.

UPDATE- after several hours at medium-loud volume the sound quality just keeps getting better.  I even had to turn it down; as the speakers loosen up and the amp breaks in it'll become noticeably louder and deeper. WOULD BE GREAT IF JAWBONE MADE A LITTLE BLUETOOTH SUB TO GO ALONG WITH IT :)",5.0

I was surprised to find that this improved the 4K picture from the projector onto the screen by quite a bit.  I guess it's the active chip embedded in it that is responsible for the overall improvement in UHD quality because the cable I was using supports the full 60hz refresh rate required by the HDR 4K player.  It works really well with the HDR feed from the Panasonic 4K player it's hooked to.

I really haven't used Monoprice cables before but the improvement is very noticeable and I'm really happy with it.  I'll probably replace the rest of my set-up with Monoprice cables this Spring when my budget allows.  For now all I can say is it's doing a superb job for me.  Connections are tight and don't wobble loose and it has a thin profile on the connectors on both ends.  If it improves a projector's 4K output then it must work wonders for a television set up.

The case shown on the product description has a large, stylized peony centered on the front cover.  Very attractive.  But the case I received has the peony shifted so far to the right that you only see the extreme left edge of the flower.  You can't even tell that it is a flower.  All I see on the cover of my case is the woody stem, a few leaves, and the extreme edge of two flowers.  Not a very pleasing composition.  There is also a 1-1/4""  ""incipio"" logo in the lower right corner that is not shown in the production description/image.

But from a construction stand-point the Incipio cover is well made.  The cuts are precise, the stitching is tight and uniform, and the plastic grips hold the Kindle securely in place.  The interior fabric is baby soft, and there is an interior pocket that can hold a small photograph.  The magnets that hold the case close are a little weak, but I haven't had any problems with it opening in my purse.  There is also no automatic ""wake"" feature on this case, but the button used to turn the Kindle on/off works fine.

12853252,"I previously owned a pair of QY7's that were great. I gave them to a friend and ordered another pair myself. These headphones sound great, especially for the price, and I was amazed of such great sound quality from a Chinese voice brand product.

When you first receive these headphones, when turning them on while inserted in your ear, you may hear a Chinese voice speaking to you. You can change this setting yourself to English, or turn off any voice completely with the included manual.

Unfortunately, after a few days of use, the left earbud broke. I have already issued a return order for these headphones in the end.

This may be at the fault of Nobsound as I did not purchase QY7 earbuds from Nobsound before but from a generic brand on GearBest.
These headphones sounded great for the short time that they worked and are extremely clear and rich in sound but I believe the TaoTronics Wireless Headphones Sport Earphones sound even better and are a much better value. The QY7 is heavier though and feels more premium.

I wanted the interior material (I don't know if this is leather or leather like)to be black and this was one of the only Javoedge covers that had black inside. I chose Javoedge because of the great reviews and because the Kindle slides in from the top and there is no way whatsoever that my Kindle will fall out of it! I don't work for them and actually had never heard of them before but I'm happy I took my chances with them!!

Who knew you could actually (with the stand open) balance the Kindle on a pillow or on your knee while reclining? It surprisingly is very stable even when I move a little. I LOVE not having to hold my Kindle! I have a bulkier style book light that works okay with this cover so maybe the flip cover isn't the best style to have for reading in bed? It still works, though.

Obviously the dynamic range of a digital source is much more revealing than music from FM. At first with only FM I was a little underwhelmed. It seems that holding off was a good idea. Now that I have everything working and can play music to these from a digital source I am very happy. It turned out that the underwhelming sound was from the limits of the music source and not these speakers.

 I'm not going to pretend to be some audio expert. The fact also is that like beauty, sound is a very personal as well. That said I'm very happy with the sound of these and also surprised at the strength at the bottom end. 6x8s have never been a first choice size for me as even though they are only 1 inch smaller than a 6x9 they are made to fit in a much more compact area. I wasn't expecting much bottom end and was pleasantly surprised by what I heard. These also seem to pretty strong in the mid range and for some maybe a little too strong. For me though it compliments my front speakers pretty well as those seem to be a little lacking in the mids.

I have these installed in the rear of my 1996 F250 extended cab. It should be noted that I needed to use a spacer to fit them in there as the magnet was hitting the sheet metal at the back of the speaker opening. Even with the spacer it is very tight. This is one reason why 6x8's are made so compact. Keep this in mind if you also have a limited space behind the speaker opening. Also, the volume behind the speaker is likely less than ideal so these may work even better in other installations.

One press gives brightest white light. Pressing within three seconds dims the light.  Each press dims the light for two or three times for longer battery life.  Three seconds after the last press, one press turns off the light. (You don't have to cycle through all light modes to turn off the light, as with other lamps.)  If the first press is held for three seconds, the red light comes on.  A second press will make it flashing.  This headlamp requires only one AA battery.

16407871,"This might just be the best laptop I have ever owned, including MS Surface Pro, Samsung, Toshiba, Lenovo (and IBM's), Sony ... (too many to think about).  I think lenovo has finally gotten it right.
1) The keyboard is excellent, and Lenovo has done a minimum of layout changes this time (I hate the other Yoga keyboards).  The key press distance and resistance are compatible with an excellent typing experience.
2) The track pad is appropriately sensitive, with minimal falsely recognized finger positions/actions.
3) The screen has excellent clarity (this is not the OLED model).  I have not assessed it for photographic accuracy.
4) The enclosed pen is satisfactory, but I like my own stylus's more.
5) The weight and size are acceptable.  At 2.8 lbs for a 14"" screen one shouldn't complain, but while waiting for the next 6 oz to shed my existing machine migrated to a child's possession so a new laptop was the order of the day.
6) I love the ""Yoga"" format for presenting to clients or watching movies on a skimpy airplane tray.
7) The i7 processor is fast enough to avoid ""getting in the way"" when working.
8) There was no significant bloatware to remove.  That usually accounts for the first 2 hours of computer ownership.
9) WiFi reception has been excellent, even in marginal areas of my home.
10) Battery life is satisfactory.
11) Oh yeah, and the unboxing experience with a self-lifting presentation of the laptop is quite impressive.

Are there any negatives?  Not really ... I have some ongoing wishes for Lenovo, however:
1) Please thin down the charger brick.  it's nearly twice the thickness of the machine.  How dumb is that?  And, by the way, add a courtesy USB charging port to it.
2) The width could probably be shaved a bit.  Dell doesn't need 3/4 inch on each side of the keyboard.
3) Update the Bluetooth driver.  My&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-MX-Anywhere-2-Wireless-Mobile-Mouse-Long-Range-Wireless-Mouse/dp/B00Y09IWGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech MX Anywhere 2 Wireless Mobile Mouse, Long Range Wireless Mouse</a>&nbsp;wouldn't stay paired until I did.

After a few weeks and a good EQ custom profile I can't say anything negative about this soundcard. Sure, onboard audio is at the point of not even needing ""Old tech"" like this anymore, but it fixed my popping issues and with my current settings feels to me sounds WAY more pricey than it is.

Even when played at high output levels, the quality is excellent. But.........there's always a but. This unit has difficulties keeping the bluetooth connection.

I thought long and hard on whether or not to try a second unit. But with other folks having similar problems, I decided to return the unit for a refund. Too bad because the sound quality was fantastic. I also thought about purchasing the Airplay Audio Dock. But from other reviews by pros, they had streaming issues with the wifi signals.

13704382,"This is one of the most exciting devices I've come across in the past few months. The reason is that I remember back in a few years when Bluetooth earpieces became popular. They were big and clunky and, in my opinion, ugly for the most part. I see people wearing these, and I cringe. I very rarely wear mine, and prefer using my iPhone headphones instead.

I received this Bluetooth headset from Tronfy, and I think this one just clicks. It's really tiny and barely noticeable. There's also no protruding microphone from it. Not only that, it's very light and does not require any clip to stay in your ear. However, it comes with the clip, which would come handy if you're planning to wear it on the go or in a crowd.

Pairing was incredibly simple and quick. I was able to pair it to my iPhone 6+ as well as my iPad air. Too bad you have to on pair from one device in order to pair onto another, though. That's not the fault of the iWork, though, so no stars deducted for that.

As with many Bluetooth headphones, the features of voice which tells you when it's connected, has intuitive verbal cues and signals for when calls come in plus a multi function button which allows you to answer calls, Hang up, and assorted other kinds of functionality.

The icing on the cake is that this Bluetooth headset functions also like regular headphones. This means that if you want to watch videos or play games without disturbing others, you can use this. What I like about it, is that it works well for activities that generate sounds where you don't want to be cut off from the rest of the world. We just have this in one ear, and the other ear is freed up to listen to what your wife, boss or mother-in-law has to say.

Battery life seems to be pretty stellar. I've used it for a couple hours and the indicator which shows up on the top left corner of your iPhone, has barely budged

Overall this is something that I'm relishing using on a regular basis.
