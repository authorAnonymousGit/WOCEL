13311664,"Nice-lookin' keyboard cover love the ""sharpie"" style and the way it keeps my keyboard clean! My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that I had to learn a new style of typing where I hit the keys a lot harder, and it's therefore noisier compared to typing without the cover. Took me awhile to get used to it, but it's now comfortable.

15484597,"Mine is the i5 version and I thoroughly enjoy it!  This is my first Windows OS computer in years!  Yes, it is very thin and performs quite well.  The construction is durable and doesn't feel cheap.  It comes neatly packed with a laptop sleeve and Ethernet adapter.  No hinge issues.  Preloaded Windows 10 and excellent touchscreen capability!  I gave it 4 stars because of the big square plug.  I'm not sure why Asus decided to go with that style of plug which does not retract or fold in.  Awkward and could present a problem for travel as you'd constantly be concerned about it being bent accidentally.  And for those Linux lovers, yes it runs them just well.  I have mine triple booted:  Windows 10, Ubuntu 16.10, and LinuxMint 18. And the touchscreen works with all of them NOT just Windows.  Let me know if you have any questions!

1518816,"I read several reviews of this product and knew it had shortcomings but after trying this out upon arrival today, I was surprised that Panasonic could offer such a poorly designed DVD recorder. Wait that's not all, they have crippled so many features I don't know where to begin.
Well, first off, it will only play store bought DVD movies so I am assume it is defective and am sending it back, but as others reviewers noted, it lacks many features that even the ""cheapie""  $30 DVD players all have such as a zoom feature, eject button etc, I cannot imagine what they were thinking of!
Even though it has a ATSC tuner built in, it only picks up about half the available channels in my area. My other two HDTV's easily pick up those channels so I know they are there
I would guess that this is now an obsolete item that has been replaced by something better and for good reason.. Panasonic blew it big time!!
Don't be tempted by the low price on this, it will only disappointed you.
Personally, I think Panasonic are risking their reputation with this, I am now hesitant to buy the same brand again!",1.0

Out of the box the provided cable did not work with the device, yet it worked fine with an external HDD.  A second cable does work with the enclosure but the device will drop if I move it too much during use.

I found the unit to be well constructed - especially for the price.  Everything from the packaging to the device itself was of higher quality than I expected.

9008489,"Serious sound -- perhaps the best $sale that I've scored with!  The 'Photive Cyren Portable Bluetooth Speakers' completely surprised me with its deep, rich sound, and not to mention the huge convenience of being rechargeable.

I have 2 other portable speakers, from JVC and Logitech, and the sound coming from the Photive Cyren was so obviously louder and richer that even my dog paid notice!  The other 2 speakers at full blast never bother my dog -- I turned these on and he was definitely aware of the difference!  I should mention (for dog owners) that my dog is totally used to them now -- didn't take long, but that first time... yeah, he noticed the difference.

The Bluetooth connection has been clean, albeit a bit shorter on range than some may want I'm sure.  The link between my device(s) and the Cyren was as easy as turning it on.  The battery life has been more than satisfactory, thus far.

One minor 'issue' with the initial charging process: apparently, the unit comes charged; thus, when trying to follow the provided instructions (regarding the unit's initial charge), I was concerned that I would have to return the Cyren as it was not displaying 'charging characteristics' as described (such as its red LED remaining lit, indicating the charging process).  However, the second charge (about 3 days later, w/ frequent usage) proved that the unit is in perfect working condition.

A final note: the unit is sturdy -- seems way more dense than other portable speakers (that I own); therefore, it may be a bit heavier than most others, but it is completely worth it as its denser construction plays into its richer bass.  I keep my 'Beats Audio' enhancements on and the Photive Cyren speakers handle the added depth without any rattling or humming.  This unit will not succumb to strong winds for sure -- I would bring them camping if they didn't look so nice at home.  At home, the Cyren rests on a smooth, ceramic-tiled counter-top -- even at full blast, and despite not having rubber 'feet' beneath it, the Cyren has yet to move on its own due to the vibration of high volumes.

Bottom line: you cannot go wrong with the 'Photive Cyren Portable Bluetooth Speakers' -- you get so damn much for so dang little!",5.0
5103637,"I recently bought this stylus for sketching on the iPad. I really like the texture, thickness, and build of this stylus. It's definitely well designed and it feels like a quality product. The elago comes with an extra tip, but it doesn't come with a carrying case. The elago is roughly triangular in shape and it has a rough texture: both of these features make it very comfortable to hold.

However, I grew frustrated while using it because it would often have to track on the iPad's screen for a centimeter before the iPad would recognize that I was trying to draw a line. My hypothesis is that the elago's tip isn't as conductive as other styluses. I have since bought an AluPen stylus, and it does not have this problem. With that said, the lack of initial response when using the elago ironically makes it a good choice when painting on the iPad. (For example, using the watercolor brush in the Paper app.) Overall, I would not recommend this stylus as the AluPen is more responsive.",3.0

10583306,"Absolutely good value for money at such a price!! I bought this camera for my Disneyland trip and it was well worth. The picture is sharp and stable. The zoom function really works very well and awesome to have 50x on this tiny piece of technology. I was carrying this in my jeans pocket and never felt anything is bothering me. At first the night videos didn't look that great on auto i+ sense, once I explored the settings, I found the Night Video setting which worked awesome and videos taken after that were really awesome. Recorded the full Fantasmic show without any issues or snow. The still pictures were also high quality and can be taken during the video (the only caveat is that it would only take 2.1 mega pixels photo while taking video) otherwise it would shoot at 10 mega pixels. Battery also worked very well and may last for the whole day if taking video on and off. Love this camera and highly recommend.

Also, I posted a question earlier on this product whether we can control the video from Smartphone or not and everybody said it doesn't support it. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT IT DOES SUPPORT REMOTE SHOOTING, ZOOM IN and ZOOM OUT. I wanted this feature to take videos during my kids' school function while avoidking to block other people's vision and this camera resolved that issue. Tripod, this camera plus my Smartphone would work perfect on this. Tested already at home for remote shooting. The panasonic app is bit loosely designed otherwise the functionality works very well.",5.0

811612,"I purchased two of these headphones for my kids to use on a trip we took.  The headphone worked well everywhere except the on the plane.  No matter how high we turned up the volume, they could not hear on the plane.  But, most headphone that are not noise cancelling do not work well on planes, so I do not hold it against them.  The headphones are mostly made from plastic and were lighter than I was expecting.  I was concerned that they would bend and could break, but they have held up well.  They are very adjustable and will be able to fit a wide age range of kids.  The headphones have a soft cushion around the ear pieces that helps to pad around the ear.  I wish there was a way to fold them or twist the headphones for storage.  They were a little awkward to put in a backpack. I was afraid the head band was going to break but it never did.  These headphones held up much better than I though they might.  I like that is included a volume limiter, so that I could control how load my kids listened to their music.  The most important thing is that the kid use them and like them.  Overall for the price they are a good value and I would buy them again.",4.0
1692565,"Had few problems using the built-in US/Canada maps. Things went awry when I purchased a map of Western Europe to use with the device on my recent travels. First, the TomTom HOME software is required to install any new map. The HOME software crashed both the TomTom and my computer, and my MacBook has never crashed otherwise in 2 years of ownership.

After many weeks of headache, I finally revived the TomTom and reinstalled the software, only to find that I was unable to activate the new map that I purchased for 50 euros about a month ago! TomTom has been unable to help me, and I find this shocking. I would have been much better off buying a new GPS unit for use in Europe. Basically the device has been rendered useless, which means a waste of about $200 total including the device and the new map. The company has demonstrated complete disregard.

Basically the experience has completely turned me off to TomTom and I would most certainly not recommend this company's products to anyone.",1.0
15447438,"This microphone was purchased as a replacement for the in-built one on my new HP laptop, because the new laptop's mic was really poor quality, and my family and friends were asking me to use my old laptop because they could not make out what I was saying.  So I thought this one would be ideal, not taking up desk space, no tangled wires, always there in my otherwise unused USB port.  Well, the quality of this unit is WAY WORSE than the laptop mic.  First, the gooseneck is not strong enough to hold up the weight of the mic (which is not much!), and so it flops down on the desk, unless I hold it or prop it up against something.  When I make a test call on the Skype echo service, I can hear how horribly muffled and distant I sound... this is the case even if I hover my face right over the mic.  It is not useable for the stated purpose.  The price is low enough that I just threw it away and chalked it up to experience... I am unable to believe all the positive reviews, particularly the ones that say they use it on skype... maybe I just got a lemon, I don't know... but mine was an utterly useless disappointment.",1.0
19793439,"Easy to set up, connected to WiFi without a hassle (I have 3 routers), and managed to pair up all the accessory units I purchased from Piper and others. System worked pretty good, although the camera resolution could have been better. HOWEVER.... I just learned that the alarm will push the unit in and out of battery mode repeatedly, as if the alarm were shaking the camera really hard and there was an intermittent connection in the power feed. When it does this, it is really hard to get control to disable the alarm. If it was a hardware issue, I could get a replacement unit. But no, Piper Support stated it is a software issue ((known bug) and they are working on a fix. I don't get a replacement camera. All I get is a ""Sorry about that, we are working on a fix."" I find a ""Software bug"" hard to swallow because I have one camera unit that works perfectly fine and one that does until the alarm goes off and then it goes nuts. That is not how software works, having been a hardware and software applications developer for 20+ years. Same software in both units, right?

Curious.... If they know this issue exists, why are they not testing units and shipping only those that pass?

12168115,"After trying a couple of other systems sold here on Amazon I finally decided on the Microseven system. Their equipment is excellent quality and the support is exceptional. The other systems I tried were similar in quality and the support was ok but to me actual daily user experience is what matters. To me the app is the key here. For example, how fast can I get to the recordings or the live shot feed after I get the notice on my iPhone or iPad etc. The apps I tried with the other systems were just horrible. Unfortunately it's hard to know that until you get everything set up and actually try it. I find it hard to understand how these companies can have a good product and good support and blow it on the apps. Is it perfect? No but I don't think any are. Microseven's free 24 hour motion even history, easy setup, their quick responsive support and fantastic app are hard to beat.  I highly recommend this company and their product. Oh and the Amazon Echo Show integration is amazing. I was not compensated in any way for this review. This company deserves it on it's own.",5.0

So far, a full charge has gone for 3hrs with no issues, although the battery life is supposed to be longer, just haven't needed it longer than that to keep it on. Pairs with my iPhone 6 - the only minimal annoyance is that it doesn't automatically connect every time (or maybe I'm just not doing something right) but there wasn't exactly a long, detailed instruction booklet- just what's printed on the outside of the box.

And having an online link to Logitech.com is nice also ...allowing for continuous config. I think Logitech is King. The only drawback for me is the actual small knobs/protruberances on the face of the unit, used for changing/clicking and or  sending signals from 880 to the diff devices. These knobs are almost too small and def hard to see, when wanting to use my 880. My next negative of the 880 is the placement of the channel numerals. They are placed really low on the unit.. at the bottom and are again very tiny and hard to find for large fingers...This makes for two handed usage...and I do not believe this device is for Senior citizens.

I managed to get the back off after that and put the battery in, find the button, put it back....the IPOD didn't want to close too well after that and I have it taped a bit.

Idea: since the laptop had a SDXC card slot which I seldom use, why not move my pix and music to a card and leave it permanently in place?  It works except the best transfer speed I can get out of the card on my laptop is 8MB/s.  But, in the end, I can access the music or pictures in anyway that I want without issue.  I just wonder why the transfer speed was slow.  It probably was the laptop and not the card.  Or maybe write speeds are far slower than the read speeds of the card.  If you plan to use the card in this way you can probably get away with a slower card.",4.0

No cords to have to deal with, it recharges with a USB cord. It is so light weight and versatile. It makes it convenient to take anywhere. It also has a beautiful blue LED light that you can choose to turn on as well. I at first couldn't figure it out, but then I read on some other reviews that all you have to do is hold down the on button while it is on any speed and low and behold, it does work. You can also choose to hit the on button 3 times and instead of the fan, you can use it as a flashlight. A little white light will turn on in the bottom right hand corner. Now it is not a blinding light by any means, but will work in a pinch until you can get to a proper light. The only negative that I can say about this fan is that I wish that you could tilt it up or down, but other than that, it is a great fan that I absolutely love!

I put this GPS through its paces as a pizza delivery guy and even went on several long road trips to the southern US and up to Canada as well. It was well worth the money and I only wish it would have lasted a little bit longer.

The death of the GPS seemed explainable. I went to an address in a city I was unfamiliar with and used the GPS. When I got there I took the GPS off the mount and put it out of public view. When I came back to my car it looked as if something had hit it and there were cracks emanating from what looked like an impact location. I have no idea how this happened. It was as if the GPS self destructed.

This feature alone made it twice as fast to input all the addresses. The screen, user interface and menus were over all far superior with the Magellan as well.

3322789,"I was fed up with paying $97 a month for my basic cable so I did some research on the available DVR options, which is the only reason I stayed with cable. This one seemed to stand out above the rest in the price range because of the DVD recording, the digital tuner and the DVR functionality (pause, play, record, rewind, fast forward live TV).

There are two things to watch out for with this unit.

1.  Finalizing a DVD requires a few extra steps (See the post by Jeff4U)
2.  The Auto-clock feature will screw with your system (again, Jeff4U's comments has the fix)

While they do add to the complexity of the unit, they are able to be overcome.

I've read that a lot of people don't like that it only has one digital TV tuner. So you can't watch one program and record another. With my setup I have an outdoor digital antenna that I patched into my existing cable coax, so I didn't have to run any new cable. Then I split the video signal before the TV so I have one line going to my TV and one to my Magnavox 2160. Since the Magnavox is using an HDMI cable and my broadcast is using a coax, I just switch between the two inputs and can record on one station while watching another. Or, with my Roku box (which, by the way, RULES!) I can watch a movie while recording something else.

I know that not everyone will know how to crimp on new coax ends or maybe maximize the signal quality but again, a little research can help with that. I think this unit is worth while. You may have a little fiddling-around to do but you can make it work for you. I'm now saving over $80 a month and in three or four months, this unit will start paying for itself.

DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!
This router worked great for 6 months. Recently the 5GHz channel drops in/out badly, making 5GHz nearly unusable.  The 2.4GHz still works good.  I did very extensive testing, no local interference from nearby routers or other wireless products.  I reset the router, upgradeD and downgraded the firmware.  It is confirmed to be a hardware problem...

Now for why I'm really writing this review.  The customer service of ASUS is the WORST!!!!!  You tell me if you would be happy if you had to be without wireless for 2 weeks, while you had to send in a faulty product.  I know I'm not.  I requested ASUS to provide a pre-replacement product, whether it be new or refurbished, so my household would not be without internet for the service period. I even offered that I would happily provide them a form of payment that they could charge before sending me the pre-replacement, and then they could remove the charge after receiving my faulty unit and proving the defective product was in fact not fault of the user.  ASUS absolutely refused this and said they can not and will not send a pre-replacement no matter what.  I told them they should provide better support for one of their premium products they sell....but they could care less.

Now I'm left with 2 options:
1. be without internet and have a screaming toddler and wife for 2 weeks while ASUS fixes their piece of junk
2. go buy another router from a local store to have internet while ASUS fixes their junk
(I will realistically be left choosing option 2)

Sadly I should have stayed with the Linksys router I had.  I stupidly tossed it after the RT-AC87U worked for a couple months no problem.  My linksys worked great for the 6 years I had it.  Sadly, the RT-AC87U is a $237 piece of junk that doesn't last 6 months....PATHETIC!!!!!",1.0

I plugged the USB wire (included) directly into my laptop and hit the power switch, and it started working immediately. No software had to be downloaded, it just supplied power from my laptop and it worked! This fan has 2 speeds, low and high. I personally don't have any complaints about the noise this fan produces. As I said, I work in an office setting and even on high, it doesn't bother me or anyone around me. This fan is very effective for such a small unit. The air its able to move is enough to cool me right down after taking a walk outside on a hot day or if I start to feel the heat inside when the ac isn't cranked up in my office. The stand is adjustable so you can tilt it back and forth for the perfect angle. I have to say, I would absolutely recommend this for anyone looking for a desk fan to help cool them off.

The picture quality of regular cable TV and DVD are far above most, in my opinion(I'm not an expert, but I've looked at a few sets, and have been looking for a HDTV for awhile.) I've owned this for about 1 month with the following problems: most seriously, it refused to turn on the other day, and it has required more and more button presses to finally get it to turn on. I have finally decided to just leave it on all the time; it sits crooked on its base which I cured by wadding a paper towel and placing it under one side of the base.

UPD. After 3 months of intense use. Raising the grade by one star -- like it more now than initially. Some observations:

PROS:
- BT adapter storage slot inside the mouse. AA+ feature. I usually carry the laptop and leave the KB/Mouse set on my desk, so it's very convenient to keep the adapter where the set is, and never worry about losing it.
- Mouse has response speed control button, and a power-off switch
- KB keys are standard size, not mini-laptop (unlike one prominent ""L"" manufacturer's budget models) so you don't find your fingers fumbling over tiny keys spaced too close.
- Key travel depth in the keyboard is short, but feels clear, with a quiet click in the end;
- Some through holes in the keypad (under the keys) allow easy and quick cleaning from dust and lint underneath the keys using a regular vac.
- The KB battery is still alive after three months of use. Given it's a single AAA, I didn't expect it to last this long.

CONS:
- Batteries weren't included with the KB, hence extra travel to a store to get 2 *different battery types* (unlike the 'L' company, using different type in KB and mouse too, but at least including batteries)
- The black plastic on the mouse top and buttons has this super-fine matte texture that easily collects grease and wears off, so after a few weeks it looks like someone used it for a long while, and largely neglecting hand sanitation, too.
- Non detachable wrist support at the lower KB edge. Kind of convenient, but has rough anti-slip grooves, so i'd probably prefer having none.",4.0

147819,"This is my first foray into digital cameras, after decades of 35mm shooting - both snapshot and 'enthusiast'.  My first impressions were great - it's a super-lightweight camera, and the zoom is awesome.  The 'USB storage class' device is fantastic - plug into your computer, and bingo - a new hard-drive shows up and you can copy pictures - easy (zero software installation)!  And the macro feature is awesome.
But the negatives cropped up after a month or so. I took a bunch of pictures at a Christmas gathering using the flash.  To my horror (since I didn't take any backup pics on my 35mm camera), many of the pictures were blurred. Since the flash 'freezes' the motion, this could not be a movement problem; much research into this revealed that most digital cameras use a 'contrast' method to focus, and in low-light, they can't get a good focus (compared to snapshot 35mm cameras, which use infra-red). The camera has to focus before the flash fires, so there has to be enough light WITHOUT the flash to get a good focus.  So beware in low-light conditions.  Second problem is that this camera has an 'Electronic Viewfinder' - what you see in the viewfinder is a 'mini-lcd' screen.  This has a lot of advantages, but - in low light (eg outdoors, where you plan to take advantage of the up-to-16 second exposure), you cannot see the image at all in order to 'frame' it.  An optical viewfinder does not have this drawback.  That's it so far for the negatives.  Since I like taking low-light shots these limitations are significant.
Note that many higher-end cameras have the electronic viewfinder, and many digital cameras use 'contrast' focus only.  I would personally recommend finding one with good optical viewfinder, and one that has an 'auxiliary infrared focus' device.  Maybe hard to find.",3.0

I wanted to go with 27"" but in retrospect I don't think downgrading to 24"" would've been a big issue if I had just moved the monitor closer to me on my desk. In terms of performance, the monitor is great and I don't think I can ever go back to 60 or 75hz from the experience of 144hz. The smoothness in-game from frame-to-frame is incredible and very fluid. This is especially apparently when turning or aiming in FPS games like Overwatch. It changed my gaming experience completely.

That said, at first I was having a problem with a ghosting effect while playing FPS games whenever I was moving the screen quickly. To counter this I changed the Displayport type in the monitor's settings and it seemed to fix it. Also the colors are a bit washed out but through my Nvidia graphics card's digital coloring in the Nvidia control panel software I was able to counter that. I tried adjusting the colors through the monitor's internal settings but it didn't seem to work too well and using Nvidia control panel was much better.

All in all, a great monitor for the price for anyone looking to upgrade to 144hz and up their FPS game.",4.0

1. DVDs boot up quickly and it plays them perfectly. I've tested a few movies out and I don't even notice layer changes (a BIG problem with the KLH).  There does seem to be a fair amount of flicker with contrasting colors on some menus.
2. Photo/MP3 CDs play well and are easy to navigate.  However, vertical photos don't seem to play and MP3 filenames can be cut off if they're too long.  The flicker shows it's ugly mug again on photos, but is easier to ignore.

Overall, I'd give this player 4.5 stars but had to round up.  The flicker problem could just be my TV or the way I'm hooking it up, I don't know.  My only other real criticism is the remote.

A bit deceiving when you first hold them being so light, they appear to be fragile but the
construction is of ""sound"" quality. The side phone adjustments work well and even during a
vigorous walk there is no slippage. The phones are very comfortable, but I find them slightly
on the small side. It takes very little time to adjust to them, after an hour or two they are hardly
noticeable. When folded they compact nicely but beware of the cord. They're good looking too.
I've had them for a month now and the polished finish seems durable..in and out of my backpack
every day and there's not a scratch om them.

Cons: The cushions could be slightly larger and the 5 foot cord is too long. Not much to complain about.

Obviously better savings then with the regular priced $259 and current offer of a manufacturer mail in rebate of $30. My strong advice is search around to see if you can purchase Manfrotto tripod mount parts separate before you order. The ball head is phenomenal and happy that I finally purchased it.

17112209,"Not being familiar with the world of ""sketching,"" or,  iPad note taking, this Adonit Pixel stylus was a new tech experience for this reviewer.
Amateurs beware.
There is no helpful book of instructions, no manual nor FAQs either enclosed in its sleek packaging box, or, on its glitzy website which invites the user to a menu of useable software programs (which you can purchase, or, test run in limited fashion). Sink or swim. So as a test, I plunged.
The Adonit Pixel ""synced"" with Tayasui Sketches II, but not with Penultimate, Sketchbook X or Notepad+. The packaging reads ""Bluetooth enabled,"" but the device did not appear on my Bluetooth devices on the iPad Air 2 used for this review. With Tayasui Sketches II, the Pixel's  two stylish suppressed buttons, when pressed, ""undo"" and ""redo"" recent coloring or lines. That seems to be its sole advantage.
It comes with a clever USB magnetized charging dongle which when plugged into the USB port charges the Pixel and shows a tiny slash green light/red light combo which - without a manual - means little to the amateur. Red light, green light;  stop/go, who knows ?
The price for this limited pixelated ""techno"" pencil is $ 79.99. Other pencils are available for 1/3 the price (they may even have manuals online). There seems little justification to pay more.  Apple's Pencil is more expensive but it comes with the Apple Genius Bar who really know their devices and are there to help.",2.0

When it is turned on it can get quite warm especially if anything is placed on top of it. It even almost got to hot to touch when I had another box on top that wasn't even blocking the airflow slots. 2) If it gets unplugged or loses power for a few minutes then all the presets, (stations being assigned a number for quick access) are blown away. You have to program them back in. 3) For my old eyes anyway, the display isn't very readable from more than 4 or 6 feet away because there isn't enough contrast, unlike my receiver's display. 4) The background of the LED display stay lit fairly bright. That may be an issue in a room where someone sleeps and likes it very dark. (On the plus side it makes a good night light!) 5)HD stations and sub channels can take several seconds to tune in.

Mary Bridget Washburn  needed desperately to get out of the life she was currently living, but can you really reinvent yourself when you're on the wrong side of the law?  Once given the opportunity, will she be brave enough to take it and do what must be done?  Can God really use someone with her past to heal the hurts of a family in crisis?

Not too far away is a father who is caught between secrets from his past and a congregation that is divided in whether he should be their pastor; a daughter at the beginning of her teen years, who is scared and desperately wants someone, anyone to show they care; and twin babies who just need someone to love and care for them.

This book is a powerful reminder of the power of intercessory prayer, God's grace and mercy, and the way God can use his people if we'll just get out of His way.  Linda Nichols seamlessly weaves all these truths throughout this book.  You will find your heart racing as Mary runs for her life, pray with the intercessors when Satan is trying his best to wreak havoc in different situations, cry when they cry, and laugh when they laugh.

I think HP redesigned their case layout and the motherboard to use the little snaps at the end of DDR3 ram sockets to provide interior support for the heavier graphics cards (mine is a GTX 970 reference), but I didn't care for that arrangement and bought this instead. I wanted to reduce the pressures of card weight off the various sockets (PCI-E and RAM) on the motherboard.

The title of this product in Amazon is a little confusing since it mentions RCA but in fact it uses the small 3.5 mm headphone connectors that PCs support. I used a 10' Cables To Go M/M Monitor Cable with 3.5mm Audio (43096) to get from the PC to the splitter and then a similar 50' cable (43100) to make the run to the TV.  These cables save you the trouble of dealing with two separate cables -- one for the monitor and one for the audio. (I had one last complication which was that the TV required a pair of RCA inputs for audio so I needed a RCA to Mini-phone Stereo 3.5 mm adapter.)

First off, I'm no audiophile. These were the first pair of headphones I've ever owned that cost more than $10 and weren't earbuds. So, I won't comment on the audio quality. I will say that the ability to block out ambient noise is pretty good. You can easily reach a comfortable volume where the rest of the world quietly fades to nothing. I've been startled more than a few times by someone ""sneaking"" up on me.

I've also had next to zero problems with comfort. I have a normal-sized ears (or at least I like to think so) and glasses, and these headphones always fit comfortably over them. They do tend to get a bit warm after extended use, but sometimes that's nice in the cold climate where I live. The only real problem I've had is after long usage (> 2 hours), they did tend to squeeze my head uncomfortably. To be fair, I do have a large head, and a 15 minute break always relieved the pressure.

Finally, durability. After a year of use, the left speaker would stop working unless I held the cable in a certain way. Again to be fair, I treated this pair pretty roughly. It would stay in my backpack constantly, unless I was using it, and I'm sure the cable connection took a beating. Thus, I took a star off the rating, but I'm very satisfied for the price I paid.

In short, these headphones are comfortable, have decent isolation, and no comment on audio quality. I owned a pair for a year before they broke, and will buy another pair. If you're not picky about audio quality, this is a great product for the price.",4.0

4555636,"I was very pleased with this product.  Installing any PCIe device is pretty simply for the most part as long as you make sure there is a PCIe slot available.  One it was all set up I plugged my external hard drives into the USB ports and noticed a drastic increase in speed.

There are some things to keep in mind if you are going to buy a PCIe USB 3.0 card.  First, make sure that you have the open PCIe slot for the card.  Second, make sure that the devices you plan to use with the ports support 3.0 or it would really be somewhat of a waste because the device won't support the increased speed.  Finally, make sure that devices which support 3.0 are using 3.0 cables to connect or the speed will be limited by the bandwidth of the cable being used.

I had been using 2.0 ports for my external hard drives which both have 3.0 cables and support.  When I started using the 3.0 ports I noticed a significant improvement.  I transfer a lot of data back and forth regularly.  This cut the transfer time down from almost an hour to a few minutes to transfer my entire music library from my computer to the USB external hard drive.  Well worth buying.

I used the light quite a bit and found it for the most part to be a great accessory.  Nice and bright, and wrapping it around the backside of the Kindle to reflect from the side illuminated the screen nicely with no glare.  It is lightweight and so doesn't make teh Kindle much heavier to hold.  The clip is strong and stayed put when attached to the Kindle.

The only downside I found was the switch.  I was surprised to find the light on in my bag after 18 hours of travel to my destination.  Removing the batteries took care of this issue when it was packed at other points.  However, this meant storing the batteries and one more thing to find in the luggage.

I doubt there's room to fit the plugs since the mounting bracket likely will sit fairly close to the TV back itself.

Bought these from Amazon as well and have had them for about a month. Love them! They are higher in price but I feel they are worth it. Easy to adjust on my big head and I like being able to adjust the position of the mic and I can do this easily with this product and not worry about over-use or putting too much stress on the mic. It's meant to be adjusted and there's no worry that it will break. Great product.

Update: The product I recommended above was purchased on January 23,2012 and still going strong. And I'm a bit heavy-handed with my belongings and the headphones and mic still work as great as the first day I bought them. Very pleased.",2.0

2938976,"The newest iMacs - unlike previous generation iMacs  - don't have the high quality speaker systems needed to get the most out of applications like iTunes. The sound quality is tinny and muffled. However, most people don't need a full surround-sound system to enjoy their favorite tunes and vids either.

Enter the Altec-Lansing FX3022! These speakers present exceptional sound quality for the price. What sets these speakers apart from others I investigated is the rich, deep bass from the bottom speaker. The quality of sound from these speakers rivals 5-speaker systems. The bass not only stands out on its own, but it resonates throghout the room. It's like having a sub-woofer, but without the extra box, wires and hassle. In addition, the highs and mid-ranges are clear and bright.

I have two criticisms of this product. First, the directions stink - especially if you're a Mac user. The connection is tricky for iMac users as the wiring is not intuitive. Secondly, the footprint of these speakers is a little bigger than you might expect when looking at the pictures. However, it's not too much more than most computer speakers - and no where near the three piece systems that Apple recommends.

Otherwise, I highly recommend these speakers to iMac users of all stripes. These are durable, sound great and are priced right.",4.0

It was a little less money AND it was purple (my favorite color). It came VERY quickly in the mail (yeah!) and it fit my iPad Air perfectly. It did have a bit of a smell (like some others have commented on) so I just left it in another room when i wasn't using it, and after a day or two I didn't notice a smell anymore. It allows you to swivel the iPad and you can stand it up two different ways which is nice, PLUS it does automatically register the on/off feature when you open or close the case.

It's probably the camera's fault. The reason why it's failing is probably the camera isn't powerful enough to push full hd onto a large screen!.

13341874,I Really like the features that this set has. By far the best feature though is the door anchor. It is much better than the other set I owned. One of my favorite uses for the bands are the seated row. I used to have a lot of problems with the other door anchors as the space under the door would often cause the anchor to slip out and hit me while doing my rows. The anchor with this set is a lot larger than most so it really holds securely under the door and I can do my exercises without worrying about the anchor coming loose. It also fits really well in the door jamb and keeps me on track when I do chest flys and other workouts with the anchor in the middle of the door.,5.0

After successfully diagnosing the problem and correcting it, I decided not to trust it in the future... and that I would ghost the old drive to a new, larger drive.

I had a limited amount of time, and wanted to get the now running PC returned, so I went over to the Norton site and paid full price for a download version of the software.

Ghost 14 is very different than the older versions.  First, it installs several services on your system.  Second it comes with an iso image for a ""recovery cd.""  The ""recovery cd"" has no ability to copy a drive.  The only way to do it is through the windows drive copy function.  Well, I tried this several times and the imaged drive would not boot into windows, and it froze before reaching the welcome screen.  After several attempts at re-imaging I gave up and made a few phone calls.  One of my friends came over with a CD boot disc made from Acronis which worked flawlessly on the first try.

9663400,"I had high hopes for this system when I bought it.  I live in a small house and I really liked the idea of a smartphone-enabled DIY alarm system.  I figured that such a system would have the smarts and customization options that have been missing from home security.  In the end, this product is too limited and buggy to recommend.

One of the clearest and most annoying failings of the ismartalarm is the key fob.  It is a bad design with little preventing the buttons from being pressed in either your pocket or bag.  They are not recessed at all and don't resist much pressure.  It looks cool but that's about it.  My setup is barely 2 weeks old and both fobs have died from over-use.

The app isn't much better.  It has some basic options, but there is very little that wouldn't count as a necessity.  They don't do anything cool like arm the system when all the people are out of the house, or allow different reactions to different sensors.  Both of these should be very easy to implement but are missing.  I've also found that the app is a bit buggy and has crashed on both iOS and android a few times and occasionally feeling very unresponsive.

As for the sensors themselves they work best with line of sight from the base to the sensors.  If there are walls between them you lose about 50% of the specified range.

This is a product who's time has come, but ismartalarm seems ill equipped to realize the full potential.  The only real benefit to this system is the low price and zero fees.

I'm keeping it and giving it two stars because I am willing to see if it gets better over time.  It does work, and might be better in an apartment setting.

I have experience with soft boxes, so I found it fairly easy to assemble.  It is quite heavy, so a lightweight umbrella type light stand will not be sufficient.  The only problematic part on this softbox is the ball joint for tilting.  It has to be tightened down very firmly to hold the weight, or it just slips until it hits the bracket.  However, this softbox is such an amazing bargain, it is well worth this minor inconvenience.  This softbox does take up quite a bit of room and I do not like to collapse between photoshoots.

Purchased this for a recent trip to Walt Disney World. Took over 500 pictures over the course of the vacation, the majority of which came out great. It was small enough to fit in a front jeans pocket, easy to use, with a great battery time, although you may want to look into getting a spare if you take lots of pictures. Mine lasted almost two full days on a single charge, which was good, but also that ""almost"" caused me to miss a few good photo ops since it was dead. After that I charged it every day. You'll need to get a memory card; I purchased a 8GB SD and it was more then enough room for a few thousand photos.
I didn't think to bring the instruction booklet on my trip, but the camera was simple enough that I was able to figure out how to change all the functions I was interested in (flash, night type modes etc) within a minute or so.

The ""backpack"" is small and not super masculine though. You will not be able to fit everything in the bundle in the bag. I actually like the lens expansions even though they have bad reviews. They add a bit more to the basics of the camera without the purchase of additional lenses. I'm still getting to familiar with them but my initial reviews are positive. I noticed the reviews noted blur, which I did not encounter. I can see how you could easily get fingerprints on the expansions though.

-Movies have audio (C-50 video only)

-Casing designed better (C-50 rubber flaps were always coming loose)

-SuperMacro mode as close as 4cm (C-50 macro mode was horrible, only about 20-30cm focus minimum)

-Mode dial more closely resembles other SLRs, with P/S/A/M options instead of having to navigate (C-50) through the digital menu to specify whether you want the shutter speed or aperature to be adjustable

Maybe it's the fact that they are on Sony's compatible list for the drive or that they are quality discs, I don't know.  But what I do know is that the picture quality that I got from my copy was PERFECT.  NO PIXELATION, NO DROPPED FRAMES, and NO PAUSES.  A perfect burn.

I ran the Verbatim discs through DVDInfo Pro and it came back with write speeds of 2.4, 4.0, and 8.0 (see picture.)  The box mine came in says ""up to 6x speed,"" so you MIGHT be able to push it to 8x with a high speed drive.

For everyday, general consumer use you should find that these discs will give you a high quality, dependable burn.  Some may ask if they are archival quality, and I have to say that my guess is 'no.'  Unless the disc specifically says ""archival quality"" then I would assume that they are standard discs (which have been found to deteriorate over time.

I highly recommend these discs for your approved DVD+R DL burner.  (Remember to check the media compatibility of your drive BEFORE you purchase these discs or any other disc!  See your drive manufacturer's website for details.)",5.0

I like the adjustable projection display and the ability to turn the display on and off permanently or temporarily (5 seconds). Radio reception is ok - sensitive to the touch. The temperature gauge hasn't been right or near right yet but that was a minor bonus if it worked anyway so no biggie. It did power up to the correct time once I selected the correct time zone. The booklet says CR battery included but elsewhere it says not included so maybe it is? Dual alarms rock and the clock/alarm is easy to set. I use the 9 minute snooze on the radio to silence it while Im bathing and such/out of the bedroom in the a.m. and it works out perfectly that when it finally goes off (30 min), i should be out the door/on the road. People said it was cheaply made but I don't think so. And the beep that sounds when your motion is detected is not very loud or annoying, especially if you live alone or use white noise at night.

1582975,"I tried very hard to like this unit because it is solidly crafted, it has excellent battery life and it is very portable.  Trouble is, if any of your travel involves roads it might be useless.  To show roads you need to spend $100 on additonal software.  Garmin doesn't warn you about that up front which is not very fair.  Anyway I went to the local upscale camping store and told them that I would buy the $100 map card so long as they could put one in a unit there and show me the local street map. The tech there tried that but after 15 minutes he still couldn't display the local street map so we gave up. I never bought the map card and I sent back the unit and the snappy bicycle mount I got as gifts.
Unless you intend to use the unit in the woods or on the water, forget it.  But if you travel like a bear or a fish,  or if you hide stuff woods in the woods and want to find it later, it's perfect for that.  For walking & biking I decided to build a small spare external battery for an old car GPS.  That cost about 20 bucks for the rechargeable batteries and the connector wire.  Surprisingly, that was far far easier to do than what it would have taken to master this unit for walking or bicycling.",2.0

The new pair lasted me 3  months and then their replacement lasted another 3 breaking last week. I don't understand  why they had to change what was not broken with the first iteration.

2826369,"The Denon 452s are probably the deepest loudest hardest hitting sub bass phones I've ever heard (my experience is limited). They sounded good right out of the box. The mids and highs opened up after about a week of listening to them. Over all I love these very much.  These phones are balanced but with an emphasis on the bass. The bass and mids are solid, accurate, and tight with crazy bass extension. The highs take a back seat to the powerful bass but they sound good (could use a bit of extension on the high side). I can listen to these for hours on end without ever feeling fatigued. I'm using an iPhone 3G with these phones and together all of my music has come alive again.

  I've heard these side by side with the Creative ep-630. The Denons are a whole level better in every way. More accurate lower bass, better mids, and brighter highs. Against my favorite Sennheiser PX-100s the Denons have more bass and are more efficient but the Sennheisers have highs with a bit more extension and details. Both the Denon and Sennheisers have very easy to listen to highs that won't wear you out.

 If you still want more bass try an amp with these. I have a little Fiio E3 amp and as soon as I turned these on I was floored. It was like I had my own portable club complete with 15"" subs. It really was hard to believe so much impact from such little buggers. Everything opened up, a very fun listen.

These are easy to insert and remove. They are very light and small. They do an avg job of blocking out sound but like every in ear phone they transmit noise through the cables.

It is not difficult to install, but you need to take your time and make your connections securely with the proper splicing tools, and measure when you drill your holes.  The modulator has worked perfectly for me for the past year.  I would suggest understanding the concept behind how this works so that you can have a full understanding of the installation process.  My radio stations do NOT come in clearly unless I turn off the modulator.  Over-all, I am very pleased that I got to keep my original head unit an add an AUX input.

Maybe they have some stunning new option that instantly sets them apart from the rest of the players.  Or maybe they have a compelling price or product offering. But they have.  Sometimes business decisions are beyond me, because the GE camera seems to be a very run-of-the-mill camera.

At first heft, this is a very attractive camera, with a fully functioning LCD/menu system that looks good and handles well.  But, nothing new here.  It's about the same as, or perhaps a touch less functional, than a Canon camera of roughly the same price.

Ultimately, the picture quality tells the tale.  And here's the puzzle: the camera doesn't take that great of photographs.  They are OK, but the image quality to my eye isn't as good as your basic Nikon, Canon, Sony, Kodak, or Olympus.  It's a shade off, a little fuzzy, not a sharp as I'd expect.

As I've said, business decisions are sometimes beyond me.  Why would British Petroleum, after the debacle in the Gulf, go back to drilling with the same technology that had the company on the front page of very newspaper, leading the airwaves with the same, tragic images of apparently disposable sea creatures, doomed to die terrible deaths.

Maybe GE bought some bit Chinese camera maker, and thinks that slapping the fine GE brand name will sell lots of cameras (I must confess it did attract me).  Perhaps they got a lot of 1 million cameras at a terrific discount, and wanted to move a lot of cameras by putting their name on it.

I certainly don't see this as a serious move by GE into the huge consumer digital camera business.  I can see them do a specialty camera, since GE sells $1 million MRI machines and CT scanners.  They have an excellent reputation.  But why dilute the brand name with a so-so camera?

13994022,"I am so happy I chose to buy this headset. I bought this for my work at home training/job. We train in a classroom through adobe connect.
When I first plugged in the headset to my computer it automatically installed the drivers. It was a very quick setup. I didn't have any issues. The volume up and down work great. Each time I press the volume button it clicks. Each click raises the volume or decreases the volume so you know exactly how much or less your volume needs to be. The mute button, when pressed lights up when it's muted. The only button I have not tried is the answer a call button since I don't need it at this point in training. But I'm sure it works great. The cord to the headset is the perfect length I can actually walk around in my room without the headset getting pulled off.
The fact that I can fold the headset it very convenient. After work I take off my headset, fold them and place them in the space right under my monitor. That helps keep room on my desk, plus I dont't have to be afraid of them accidentally falling and breaking. The headset also comes with a nice little pouch, but I don't use it.
Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase.",5.0

Reason 1: There is no headphone jack. Both models above and below, the A33 and the AX100, have the headphone jack. As well, even in the A53 manual it states there is a headphone jack (pg 52), however on the camera where the jack is supposed to be is just a blank space.

If sony had added a rubber boot to the eyepiece for a better comfort, it might have also added to the length and kept the battery for hitting my face every time I looked through it, but alas, twas not to be.

So that's it. The a53 isn't a bargain bin camcorder, and for sony to sell a $1,000 camera (I know, currently discounted for $850) that is supposed to be geared towards semi-serious videography, with such a critical design flaw as a literally obstructed use of the viewfinder, has me seriously questioning sony's intention in the camcorder game. I was pretty bummed to return the camcorder and don't like being stifled from the productivity I had planned, but I will mention Panasonic has just pre-released a new camcorder (wxf1k) in the same price range that looks promising.",2.0
11976436,"I bought 3 of these puppies and they work as advertised. Not only can you switch outlets remotely, but the units can also do automated switching, either if Internet connection is lost, based on a schedule, or if a specific gadget on your network becomes unreachable.
Configuration via the web interface is simple and straight forward. The built-in webserver even supports ""responsive"" webpages, which means that if you connect via a web browser on your mobile phone or tablet, you get a mobile friendly layout of the configuration pages, with large selection buttons and menus. I'm impressed.
Now some nitpicking:
The suggested remote administration via Google Talk is a bit bizarre in my opinion. If you don't trust Google to access electrical outlets in your house, a more secure way in my opinion is to establish a VPN tunnel to your home network and then simply access the units built-in webserver. For some reason this more secure and straight forward approach is not described in the manual",5.0

Even more than usual the wattage of this amp is overstated, but once again it proves that you get what you pay for.  Other than that the amp works fine. The specifications don't specifically say it's stable with a 2 ohm load (they do say 4-8 ohms), but I'm powering two 4-ohm 6""x9"" and two 5-1/4' front speakers with it and it works fine. It is not bridgeable, and has no built-in crossovers.

It has a 10A fuse.  It only weighs 2.3lbs. Rated at 0.05THD @20W at 1kHz.  Current draw is listed at 5A, which would translate to about (5A x 12VDC = 60W input, thus less than that output).  The spec's say Output Power is 70W x 2 RMS / 120W x 2 Maximum, but that's hard for me to believe.  I would recommend spending the extra money and getting the 400W version if you like it loud.

I've had this card for a few months now, and let me say that I am quite pleased with it. If you're a gamer like me, looking for a nice card that can handle graphic-intensive games but you're a bit strapped for cash, then look no further. This little monster eats up just about everything that I throw at it. Every game I have, I can run on maxed settings, Doom 3, Quake 4, Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, Unreal Tournament 3, Gears of War... I have no games that this baby can't handle. Now, I'm sure this card would have trouble with a graphically astronomical game like Crysis, but my personal opinion is that it can pretty much handle all but the absolute most visual intensive games out there. Games like Crysis, Call of Duty 4, etc. I'm not so sure about, but based on my experience, basically anything else you thow at this card, it can handle pretty smoothly. Gears of War stutters a little here and there, but not nearly enough to make it unplayable.

Pros: Great card, low price for its performance level.

Cons: As it is an overclocked card, it does tend to get a little hot. I would recommend inserting a cheap PCI fan underneath it, and that should nicely alleviate any thermal issues.

I've run across complaints about the fan's noise level, but it sure doesn't bother me.

For example, it took over 11 hours to transfer a 5.34GB folder consisting of 50,000 files. The slow speed seems to be caused by the number of files being transferred, rather than the total storage size of the transfer. Transferring a single 1.39GB file took less than two minutes.  I can live with this shortcoming, since I use the drive for backups, and now that I've done the initial file transfer, subsequent incremental backups will be much quicker.

The look of Arcos is very bulky.  This is not my main problem.  Not user friendly sound recording is!
With 10 GB, storage is not an issue for any Jukebox type players.
Neither Archos Jukebox Recorder nor Ripflash software is a good file organizer.  It is painful to create folders and drag and place it onto the Jukebox harddrive.  The Archos Jukebox has one more problem than the Ripflash.  When i closed the MusicBox software and disconnected the protable device, an error message saying improper disconnection will cause pc hardware problems.....  I guess no one would expect to see such a message after having done everything in great care.
Voice recording
For the Ripflash,I have to admit that the voice recording function is very easy to use and very sensitive, compare to my Archos Jukebox Recorder.  Unlike the Archos Jukebox, the Ripflash allocates a new file for voice recording automatically.  The Archos one asks for a new name everytime.  Otherwise it will either replace your existing 'new song' file or refuse to record.  I missed almost 10 minutes lecture because of setting up the Archos. And the battaries ran out within an hour.  I was caught in the middle for recording exam tips!
Definetly I will not recommend the Archos Jukebox Recorder for reporters or students alike.  As a matter of fact, the RipFlash recorder is a very eligant and handy devise for recorders or students.
Final conclusion:  there is no prefect mp3 player!
With almost 90 bucks more, why should i buy Archose Jukebox Recorder10 instead of Archose Jukebox 10 or other Jukebox? I am still considing whether to keep RipFlash because of the unreliable software.  I am considering whether to replace it with Creative's Nomad II or Sonicblue Rio 800.",2.0

I have A LOT of problems with ear buds falling out of my ears and have always used over the ear style headphones because of this, but, I really wanted something sleeker and easier to clean for consistent gym/running use. These work very well not only because they have the plastic piece that goes over your ear like a clip but because the plastic piece perpendicular to the ear bud itself (where the ""KOSS"" is printed) tucks into the inner cavity on your ear to keep the bud securely sealed in your actual ear canal. I've never had these fall out when running or using weights as long as I've properly placed them. They take a while to get use to being able to put them in and out fast but after a week or two of using them the speed of putting them in was no problem.

Because it's so easy to keep the seal between the bud and your ear canal secure I've also found that they're even better than some of my over the ear style headphones for doing chores around the house where ambient noise would normally force me to crank up the volume, especially things like washing dishes. The sound of running water and clinking dishes barely gets through so I don't need to adjust the volume to keep hearing my podcasts.

I honestly can't comment much on how music is on these because so far I've used them ~95% of the time for podcasts which doesn't demand much in the way of having a good range of frequencies perform well. The little music I've listened to using these has been good given the price point and met my expectations.

Cleaning out the earbud piece has been easy since they pop on/off the harder plastic part easily and any earwax comes out fast with a toothpick or q-tip. The chords do get tangled fairly easily (especially given the ear clip part) so I've gotten in the habit of wrapping the chord into a good coil after every use.

The 850 is thinner and has a smaller ""Touch of Color"" frame around the screen and comes with a rectangular base rather than the oval one that came with the 650 which makes it more stable (most of you probably mounted it without the base though).  The remote looks and feels about the same between the 850 and the 650 but gone is the ""Picture Size"" button that manually allowed you to select between the 16:9, 4:3, etc., as this is now automatic.  It's got better ergonics overall and the only down side is the lower fidelity speakers necessitated by the 1.9"" thickness frame.  We knew this up front as the 850 was part of a Home Theater with external surround sournd speakers.  You can also opt to place 2 external speakers by the output of from the 850 if it's not part of a Home Theater system.  You no longer need a USB Wifi like with the 650.  Both the 850 and 650 are excellent HDTVs and I'd recommend them both...",5.0

Pros:
The color is great and it can easily be seen in a bright room.
It doesn't lose its image on a bigger wall
It fixes well on a wall from any position
The eco options can be use full, in making me fell like I am saving energy by dimming the picture
It's not to heavy making it easy to carry around
The fan doesn't sound very loud, it doesn't distract the audio

Cons:
You can not output the audio from the projector makes setting up audio more difficult
The projector doesn't have a headphone jack, you can only use audio plugs for sound
The projector size can get in the way if you want to hang it at all
It gets really hot some times, and once in a while can have a odor like something is burring
The start time can feel lengthy at times
The price of the projector don't give this a feeling of a complete package, I feel committed to the the projector more

You can easily hear fret and fingering noises when listening to folk or classical guitar, for example.

My only concerns are the design and construction. I like my subwoofer on the floor and my satellites widely separated, so the short cables are not good. Having the volume and tone controls, headphone, and auxiliary input jacks on the satellite speaker is very convenient--but the power switch is on back side of the subwoofer, which is a pain if it's on the floor. Mine is under the desk, so appearance is no problem. I simply faced the speaker backward, so the switch is facing front, and I can hit it with my foot.

Finally, like some others, my subwoofer's reflex tube was lying loose in the subwoofer upon arrival--as evidenced by poor bass response and loud buzzing with certain bass frequencies. I carefully unscrewed the speaker and laid it aside, then retrieved the reflex tube (about the size of a toilet paper tube, but much thicker cardboard). I reglued it in the socket using Elmer's Carpenter's Glue. Reassembled everything, and then the sound was amazing.

If you can live with the design shortcomings, though, you'll love the sound.",4.0

10918327,"It  works well enough to get by in a pinch, the keyboard layout and size is better than the Logitech K400 but is has some inexcusable design and operational characteristics:

Function keys are also media keys; the markings for media are blue and are the default action, the F# is white like the rest of the keys but require the right-side Fn key.

No right-side control key, this affects me as I use VirtualBox intensively on multiple systems and the default host control key is the right control and I am not customizing it for one keyboard.

No wake-up/power on key; if you accidentally ""F4"" without the Fn button, you put the computer to sleep and must go to the computer to wake it up.

Touchpad is abysmal; random clicks from touch, the one-piece pad buttons have poor feel, scrolling and motion is not smooth and scrolling is Apple-style, i.e: you move fingers as though you were moving a sheet of paper rather than a scroll bar. Also, attempting to hold and drag is nearly impossible and precision is poor.

Frequent key latency, occasional no-registers and rarely misses a character.

The operational complaints may partly the fault of the wireless; if I stand next to the  transceiver with the keyboard, performance seems to be slightly better. I have tried it in different locations with the same results.

I purchased this amp because it was half its original price and a little cheaper than the fiio e6. This amp is fresh on the market and has only had a few reviews to sway my decision to purchase it so I dived in head first just to see what I've been missing out on portable amps.

My inital impression is the, 'thud thud thud thud...', bass. There is much bass as expected from what is said on the box, '...with bass enhancer'. Despite the strong and noticeable bass, the sound is strong also on the highs. As someone else has put it, based on the audiophile website, the sound can be described as a V shape, noticeable highs and noticeable bass, and somewhere in the middle are the mids. Still, mids can still be heard clearly because the amp makes the sound very warm and pleasant to listen to. I used Grado Labs SR60 to test this amp.

This amp is a worthwhile for the sale price. If you are into thud thud thud music such as club music, R&B, Rap, and select indie songs you will have a good time with this amp. Basically a party in your headphones. :)

9536457,"I'm a budget builder and needed a budget mid tower with plenty of room, this has it!  I also wanted to go with a blue LED them and the stock fan already had it started.  I moved the stock fan to the rear, I added 2 transparent 120 mm Rosewill blue LED fans to the front, and 2 Corsair 120 mm blue LED fans to the top, as well as a blue LED light bar that hid very well up under the top edge lip. It looks great!

Out of the box the case seemed a little flimsy but once all the components were installed it became very sturdy but not too heavy.  Lots of room for wire management and case fans, tool less drive bays, and a very versatile side window that can be used as a window or for fans. The case has a heavy industrial look which is what I wanted and came together really well with the Apevia Iceberg 680 watt PSU. There is still enough room to add a small water cooling loop which is on my to do list.

Its not really clear in the description but the 2  front circle ""vents"" have blued LED's that light up for power on and HDD activity.  I added a blue LED fan behind them because I wasn't aware of it until I powered the whole system up. The stock fan just has a 2 pin molex so you won't get any fan regulation with it from the motherboard, that's why I moved it to the back, it will just run full speed full time. The front bezel pops on and off easily to access the front fans and such, and the removable/replaceable drive bay covers are a nice touch. This case with the 120 mm fans dropped my overall system temp by more than 10 degrees.

Some things I would recommend to be added/changed were more black fan screws, slightly wider cable management plenum behind the motherboard shelf (but only because I didn't buy a modular PSU), and 2 stock fans instead one.  All in all this is a great budget case that has unique looks and should at least get your friends to take a second look, I highly recommend it.

6339893,"I feel like this stabilizer will work well for very lightweight cameras, but I am using a Canon 5D MKII and could not get consistent results.  If you bump the camera at all you have to recalibrate the stabilizer, which is awkward and requires a stable surface or you end up bumping the other arms out of whack and having to start over.

The gimbal seems to work well for horizontal tilting, and vertical 'bobbing', but any sort of involuntary horizontal wrist twisting (left to right) came directly through to the camera, so when I was able to get it stable, my footage was ""twisting"" left and right if that makes sense, to the point where it would actually start rotating the camera on the gimbal and I'd be filming a wall.  Part of this could be technique, but remember that all of my shots have been slowly walking, I'm not doing anything crazy.  I think it was the weight of the camera (using a light 50mm prime lense).

exceeds my hopes, after trying 3 different POS Belkin n routers which
all had problems, and were returned.  My router which this extender

compatibility problems with it.  I ran tests using (free) Xirrus Wi-fi

paperwork and with no blemishes or defects at about half the new price.

I liked it so much I bought two. One for my 13"" MacBook and another for my 15"" MacBook Pro. To start, the cushioning around the ""laptop container"" area inside the bag is extremely well designed. Snug, and padded completely on all sides, including the top (by a split, fold-in foam ""bridge"" that closes when you zip the bag shut). The foam padding is the good stuff; dense and quickly retains its shape. Maybe .5""-.66"" thick and is encased throughout in silver nylon so you can't tear it or dislodge it by accident. I always feel like if I accidentally drop the bag, my laptop is going ot be totally fine. It's a great piece of mind to have.

Secondly, the front pocket has plenty of room for a large AC power back and cord, mini-drives, DVI cords, pens, and even a Wacom Stylus.

What a revelation, these NiZn batteries last and last in my digital camera, I have never had them go dead on me, I take a spare pair but have never had to change them out. I am happy and my wife is happy. They were so cheaper than NIMH's which are pretty much useless in devices that need a decent voltage to run.

You likely know what each item does if you are here.

The grid is nice and does a good job of constraining the flash to just where you want it.  I just got the grid color filters yesterday, and have not yet tried them, but I am sure they work every bit as well as the Speedlite filters which came with this kit.

The flashbender works great and gives versatility to your flash work.  The diffuser is alright.  I have not used it much, but it does fit well on the flashbender.

Rogue seems to make nice products, and the fact that they give you a well made wallet and index cards with F stop loss with the filter sets is a plus, too.

If you are looking to get any of the Rogue accessories, you can't go wrong with this set.  There is one larger set, but I opted not to get both sizes of flashbender, just the large.

So far they have been exactly what I was looking for. The filters come in their own labeled individual cases and a pouch to organize them and keep them together as well as a microfiber cloth to keep them clean. The reason I chose square filters over screw on is because they don't have to be replaced for EVERY SINGLE LENS (and I have 3 with one on the way).

I bought this product with the intention of using it as a means of cloning drives (using internal hard drives docked in the BlacX 5G and cloning my external hard drives and computer hard drives using Carbon Copy Cloner). When I first started using the device with brand new hard drives, it would eject the drive mid back up. I just thought it was weird and thought that maybe the USB chord was a dud and just restarted the cloning process. It finished and everything seemed to be there on the secondary drive so I just thought it was a one-time deal. However, every time I've tried to use this device to clone drives, it does the exact same thing--ejects the drive mid way.

I ended up getting another docking station for my office, NOT the Thermaltake BlacX 5G but the NewerTech Voyager Q docking station from Other World Computing: [...], which works great! However, whenever I brought a drive home and tried to mount the drive on my computer, it tells me the drive is not readable by my computer even though the drive works fine in the NewerTech docking station. (I should note that the drives I had previously formatted and used on the 5G docking station, worked just fine on the NewerTech docking station and I could read and write the drives.) So, in essence, if I want to use a drive with the 5G after having formatted it on the Voyager, I would have to reformat on the 5G and re-clone...which is just highly impractical and a waste of time.

The thing is made entirely of plastic, which actually seems to be pretty good quality. The problem, however, is the mechanism the designer used that allows you to tighten it onto your desk. The problem is that as you twist the bottom portion and the flat bit presses more firmly against the bottom of the desk, instead of growing tighter the bottom bit just starts bending down. Its simple physics: Equal and opposite action. The desk pushes back against the bracket and since the bracket is flimsy plastic, it bends. This means that the hook end up kinda loosely attached to the desk.. I think if I tighten this thing any more its going to snap.",2.0

  The Blu-Ray PQ even at 1080i is also a noticeable improvement.  As my previous DVD player was a high quality Sony, I did not expect much of an improvement in DVD PQ.  The up-converted picture from the Sony 550 is better.
  The increased time for the player to boot up takes some adjustment but it is a minor problem. The remote contains the most non-ergonomic design I have ever encountered.

It complements the internal fan installed in my Hartke Kilo amp and together they keep the amp's operating temperature well within allowable tolerances.  I can't say that the Kilo's internal fan wouldn't have been sufficient by itself its just that I wanted more assurance since the amp is mounted in the Gator enclosure.  The only downside I can report is that the fan array is not quiet; in fact its quite noticeable when not playing.  But once you begin playing, it doesn't seem to present a problem.

5757187,"First off, the specs for the PC that this card is installed to:
Dell Optiplex 755 Desktop (with a few modifications)
Core 2 Quad Q6600
8GB DDR2-667 RAM
GTX 750 Ti (completely irrelevant, but I love to brag about that time I made a 750 Ti fit inside an Optiplex DT chassis)
Windows 10 Home

I'd like to point your attention to that last line: Windows 10 Home. Yes, this card will work on Windows 10, and it'll work every bit as well as it would on Windows 7. I've had no issues getting it up to 88-90Mbps down when setting the PC up for testing. While you'd certainly want to take advantage of the faster PCIe slot on newer machines, many older computers have no PCIe slot, or, as in my Optiplex's case, they only have a single PCIe slot, and that's needed for a graphics card.

Not only is the signal fast, but it's reliable. I've had no problems holding a signal for Netflix and gaming--yes, you can game on a Q6600/750 Ti combo--without any connectivity-related problems like stutter, buffering or, in the case of Overwatch, untimely death.

If you've got a modern PC with a micro ATX or bigger motherboard, you almost certainly don't need a PCI wifi card. If your system is on the older side, or you just like goofing around with ancient tech to make it better, this card is a fine choice for you.",5.0

But the sound quality is a different matter. While the bass is definitely more aggressive, the clarity is lost, and the sound is frankly muffled and a bit distorted. This may not matter to casual listeners who don't care about these nuances, but I found it unacceptable and unlistenable.

Found Amazon to have the best price on Kicker Front and Rear Speakers as well as the Kicker 11HS8 sub.  Received promptly as promised and installed. Since I was replacing the rear door speakers I tied on at each speaker and ran to the High level inputs on the amp. This Kicker amp greatly exceeded my expectations. I have been in bands and appreciated high quality audio at home and in the car all my life, and I must add, I am very hard to please, I guess in the category of an Audiophile. It has to sound good or I won't listen to it.  As others have said, This Kicker 11HS8 won't crack the glass but it can add more Bass than is needed for a Great sound, provided all you are needing is more Bass and a lot of Thump if you turn it up.  It is so good, I have the Bass all the way down on the Factory Radio and only running the sub at about 50% Gain with the Bass Boost on the sub amp all the way down, and that is plenty of Bass to make the music sound Great. You an also hit the 6.5"" door speakers with more power since the Bass is dialed back then put the Bass back in with the sub.  If you just want to add Bass to a stock system and make your music sound great, this will more than do the job.  Nice Clean Tight Bass with surprising Lows. Don't hesitate, buy it, you will love it.

14354356,"I think these tubes are great as an entry level product into macro photography. Unfortunately, some information is hard to come by on the internet. So I have condensed what I think is essential, and should have been provided for by the manufacturer.

If you want to know the maximum magnification these tubes will provide, I have shown the formula below in LaTex format. Use units of millimeters for all dimensions.

m = \frac{ h ( n - f ) - f^2 }{ f ( n - f ) }

m: magnification
f: focal length of lens
n: near focus point of lens
h: extension tube length (7 to 49mm)

I would like to address some concerns many people may have in purchasing this item. I really do not see the point of spending a lot of money on an expensive autofocus extension tube. Below is my reasoning.

1. How do I focus my lens with this things on? The focus range is so small in macro photography, that you will be better served by moving the camera to establish proper focus than by adjusting the lens. This is true whether you bought an expensive extension tube with auto focus or not. Your next purchase after this should be a focus rail.

2. How do I control the aperture with this things on? I use a manual aperture lens, so this is not an issue for me. But you can still use this with an electronically controlled aperture. Just put your lens on like normal without the extension tube, and then hit the depth of field (DOF) preview button the camera. While holding the DOF preview button, remove your lens and then reattach the lens with the extension tube. Your lens will now have the desired aperture selected.

Another side note. If you are using an incident light meter, you will get underexposed images if you do not take into account the bellows factor in exposure. I have shown the proper corrected exposure formula below in LaTeX format with the bellows factor added in. Ironically, this factor is never mentioned on the Wikipedia Exposure Value page.

\frac{N^2}{T} = \frac{ES}{K} ( 1-\frac{f}{u} )^2

N: numerical aperture value
T: shutter speed (s)
E: incident light (lux)
S: ISO speed
K: light meter constant (250)
f: focal length of lens (mm)
u: subject distance (mm)",5.0

This tablet is pretty easy to use and I love the size of the screen. I downloaded a couple games and out of 10-12 tries, I was able to play only once. I never got the Kindle app to work. But the most frustrating part is that it froze every 5 or 10 minutes.  I ended up sending it back.  I looked for another tablet to buy, but nothing was as good as this one is.  Since so many reviewers did not have the freezing issues that I had, I'm buying another LePan and see how that goes.  Glad returning is easy (first 30-days).
** Update 4-26-12 **
I received the new LePan 970 and before doing anything I downloaded and installed the newest firmware.  After 4 weeks of constant use, I'm happy to say the device has not frozen once. I'm reading with the Kindle app and playing games.  Absolutely no problems! I've updated my review from 3 stars to 4 stars and would not hesitate to recommend this tablet to others.  I would gladly buy it again.

I checked the prices at the local big chain stores (target,wal-mart,best buy, etc) and none of them had anything in the price range of this headset.

Pros:
  For me I wanted something not too bulky that I can toss into my laptop backpack and not have to worry about them sticking out and the Plantronics headset is perfect for that. I have a fairly large head (wear a size 7 5/8 fitted baseball cap) and these fit perfectly even for me wearing them extended periods of time I noticed very little strain on my ears or the top of my head once I got them adjusted to where I needed them. The headset is clear and the microphone works as good if not better than I had anticipated. The inline controls worked well and the overall assembly seems pretty tight and not too flimsy.

Cons:
  Everything is plastic and even though it should be sturdy enough to handle anything I have my doubts about that. The speakers aren't super high performance or what I would want for listening to music or playing video games if high stereo quality is a must for you you're going to have to spend more for something higher quality than this. The mic is adjustable and it works fine but there is a certain stiffness to the fully adjustable extension mic support that just leaves me feeling like it takes almost too much force to adjust it closer or further away from my mouth as though I am getting close to breaking it.

Overall the value for the money is top rate, I would highly recommend these to anyone needing a headset that you don't have so much invested in that you worry about it breaking/getting lost/etc. This is the headset for you. If you want something to use for hours on end gaming that the double as a music listening headset then you might want to look somewhere else.

So, all in all, I'm not sure if it's worth it to get this equipment (at this $60 price) just for the ease of firmware update(?)",3.0

The wire is thick (so it doesn't tangle too easily) and durable, but it's not too thick so as to be heavy or interfere with movement.  I like that the headphones come with three different sizes for the in-ear piece, so you can choose the one that fits your ears best.  There is also a microphone, so these can be used to talk on the phone in addition to just listening to music or videos.  If I had to change one thing, a clip would be nice so that you could anchor the headphones to your clothes to keep the microphone reasonably near your mouth, but that's a small complaint.",5.0
1164868,"I was in need of replacing my Magnovox DVD recorder, as it was a +R only and it was getting harder and harder to find my archival quality DVD's for it.  This RCA recorder seemed to have what I needed, and it accepted both -R and +R formats.  Set up was fairly easy, and I proceeded to start transferring home VHS movies over and using it for recording my favorite prime time shows.  Set at the 1 hour recording, the quality of my DVD's was not of very good quality.  They were very grainy and the sound was not good.  And, if I wanted to record more than an hour on a disc and set the machine at a LP, boy, the results were unwatchable.  My connections are of the highest quality, and my recordings with the Magnavox were excellent in comparison.
Utilizing this RCA as a playback only machine has it's moments as well.  It is very sensitive when there are minor flaws in the disc and will freeze, not allowing you to skip/fast foward. You have to actually stop the machine, and then fast forward by skipping chapters to try and get past the problem area, which is sometimes not possible.  I can take the same DVD and put it in a cheap Walmart brand player and it will play fine!
And, frequently I have problems when turning the machine on,,,it will freeze at the ""Hello"", and I will have to turn off and reboot.
I will be repacing this unit. I've read some really good reviews on some Panasonics, and may go that route.  Will probably keep this unit as it does have a digital tuner and maybe I can at least use it on one of my older tv's as a converter when analog signals go away next year.

I realized that while having the old speakers I had raised the maximum volume output on my sound card so i could get out more sound and then after i changed that and played some cd quality music instead of vids online I was very surprised. The speakers are actually very good and well balanced. I like the fact that you can control the base on the subwoofer and the high range isn't ear piercing.

I do have one MAJOR GRIPE about these speakers. My speakers are close to eye level and they have a VERY BRIGHT BLUE LED to show when they are turned on. It is very annoying and distracting.

Alas, I, too, was a high-volume, long-time, happy Amazon customer who now feels quite jilted by what seems to be a bait and switch routine. I've waited two months on the promise to have this plasma HDTV delivered, and still a no-show! Normally, who cares. But this was my son's birthday present. ""That's okay, Weekend Dad, next month maybe?""

Note to the Consumerist; here's a classic sales pitch ploy: ""The Loss Leader"" Some big box stores lure the consumer into their web with the promise of huge savings on low, low priced super-discounted high end products, only to have that one item disappear when the customer arrives--the product is suddenly ""out of stock, on the way, or it just sold out,"" etc. But once you've been lured into the superstore (or site) by the promise of ""low prices"" you are directed to other merchandise, or the item becomes available later at a higher price...so you quickly switch to the stack of inferior products with the higher profit margin for the big box (just to skip the wait and hassle of shopping somewhere else). I wouldn't have dreamt in a million years that Amazon might practice this kind of unconscionable marketing behavior, and truly hope it isn't so.

When I purchased this plasma HDTV I was not aware of any ""pre-sale"" characterization of the deal. The item was listed as In Stock in bold letters (fine print no doubt meaning: yes, ""in stock"" at some other vendor--but not at Amazon's low, low advertised sale price).

Due to space limitations I need to use the same device for both computer monitor and TV, and the Vizio works great in that role. (According to Sams Club's web site, theirs is model V022LF (which is the model Vizio's web site advertises), while the Amazon/Target model is V022L. It looks as if the part numbers are interchangeable, as mine (from Sams) is labeled V022L on the back.

In any case, the V022L has a nice display for HD content, but what impresses me more is the display I'm getting via a standard RGB connection to my desktop PC. I was worried that being unable to use the DVI-D connector from the video card would result in a degraded display, but the clarity at 1920x1080 through RGB is astounding (especially after running Microsoft's ClearType optimizer). All I had to do was upgrade my (nVidia) video driver and connect the monitor. I wouldn't think of using 1920x1080 on a smaller display, though, as (at least for me) the desktop features would be way too small.

Two (minor) complaints: the sound quality isn't as good as I'd prefer (2x3W output), though for the PC it's fine (and there's a standard connector for audio input to the monitor); and, the remote lacks a dedicated source button for RGB (there's one for each of HDMI, TV, component, and AV), so I have to use the Input button to scroll through the list to select RGB.

2. I took off another star for mediocre low volume sound (normal listening level in a medium size room).  You can get this type of sound from a $10 bluetooth speaker.

3. I quickly added the star back since the medium (loud) and high (very loud) volume level sound is just amazing.  The speaker sounds crystal clear even at the peak volume.  No muddiness... simply amazing.

I was driving myself a little nuts searching for a secondary player that didn't have any sort of ""smart"" features (why is it SO difficult to find high-quality ""dumb"" appliances?

EASY TO SET UP: I connected it to my TV, plugged in the Ethernet cable, and then powered it on. After some quick updates, it was ready to roll.

SURPRISINGLY ROBUST FEATURES: I had been using an Amazon Fire TV stick with my secondary (bedroom) TV, but was able to set it aside once I'd installed this player. The number of available streaming apps is borderline overkill, and the interface is intuitive and easy to use. The remote is programmable, so you can control your telly as well as the player with a single remote instead of juggling two or more.

SOLID AESTHETICS: The unit is small and unobtrusive, with a black mirror finish and an understated power indicator light.

BOTTOM LINE: Don't be put off by the ""refurbished"" descriptor. My unit arrived in like-new condition (the box looked like it had been through the wars, but the device was securely packaged), and works really well. At this price point, it would be difficult to find a better player that supports not only Blu-Ray and Blu-Ray 3D, but a mind-boggling variety of streaming apps.

14571743,Very disappointed.  I had this for 2 months then the speaker stopped working. It was beyond the return window for Amazon so I called the makers of this junk box. Sat on hold for 15 minutes listening to the worst hold music on earth only to be cut off. Called back with same result. Called Amazon with my problem and I must say Amazon was beyond helpful. Monster was complete opposite.  Since Amazon helped me out with the situation I decided to open it up since I have a fair amount of electrical knowledge. I found the speaker wires from the circuit board crushed from when they installed the side control panel during assembly. After 2 months of use the wires shorted into each other which permanently took out the circuit board.  If you choose to buy this junk box understand that monster is not available to back up their product in the case of a failure. I hope Amazon sees enough problems with this that the decide to stop offering it to their customers. As helpful as Amazon was to me in this situation I hate to see them lose money through a company like monster that will not stand behind their product.,1.0
15514462,"I like the screen,  but the instructions leave a lot to be desired. I would say that this is something you may not want to tackle if you are not comfortable with tinkering around with computer components, though most likely if that's you, you are probably not interested in a Raspberry Pi. There was little to no documentation that came with my unit, I was able to find it online by Bing'ing 'Element 14 7"" touchscreen documentation'. There you will find pretty good instructions, once you finally locate them. There are instructions for enabling the onscreen keyboard, which is pretty much useless if you ask me. I am used to keyboards that pop up contextually and disappear when you don't need them. In this case, you have to bring it forward and it isn't intelligent enough to adjust the windows you want to type into so that you can see what you are typing. I personally found the onscreen keyboard to be about useless as it becomes a foreground application and covers the screen you are typing into. I have found some ways to manually work around this, but then you have to manually adjust it when you are done typing, only to repeat the process at the next input field. In my opinion, while it's cool that you can do this, it's a clear example of poorly thought out implementation. BUT, the screen does work well and for the price, I guess I shouldn't complain. I would highly suggest an external keyboard, which thankfully I did consider before I bought this. The touchscreen works pretty much flawlessly. Sometimes the screen doesn't display the window properly, I believe that's a function of the Raspberry Pi OS not rendering properly to the screen size and resolution.",3.0

17702249,"When I got an email advertising a clearance price on the Meade Deep Sky Imager for $99, I could not resist. This imager makes a great entry level camera for those beginning to experiment with astrophotography. My first night out with the camera, I was able to image close-ups of the moon, the Ring Nebula and the Pegasus Cluster. The software is reasonable to use, though there are quite a few concepts that browsing or reading the manual, or a third party tutorial can help tremendously. This is a color imager that uses a USB interface to connect to the computer. I found the supplied 6 ft. USB cable to be a bit on the short side, and will be replacing it with a longer cable. I ran the software in Windows XP using Parallels on my MacBook Pro, as there is no Macintosh version of the software. The installation under XP requires one to ignore some operating system warnings about drivers. I have not tried the rest of the Autostar suite yet, as the telescope I was using to try the camera was an older LX200, which doesn't use Autostar. The imaging software also allows for some primitive self-guiding with an Autostar telescope and proper guiding with multiple DSIs. The imager uses convection cooling, and as such may be noisier than other imagers from competitors, but no one comes close to the low price of this imager. The DSI should go a long way to introducing beginners to digital astroimaging or to give a low cost alternative for those with a bit more experience. A software update on the Meade site adds NASA's Drizzle technology which can be used for mosaics or increasing the resolution of the output image. It also allows one to deal with field rotation in an Alt-Az mounted telescope.

The DSI has already been replaced by a newer version, which is why the original is available at such a low price. I was very pleased with the results I got from my first two nights with the imager, and will expect even better results once I have my imaging scope guided during exposures.",4.0

14816698,"At first glance, fx-991EX looks like a modernized version of fx-115ES PLUS. However, it has some shortcomings, compared to the predescessor:
1) Missing functions: LCM, GCD, Remainder division, Recurring decimals, and Product calculation - I have no idea why it was necessary to remove these important functions, so this is definitely a downgrade and a disappointment! Moreover, it turns out these features are available on some foreign versions of the same calculator, which leaves me wondering why the Casio marketing decided to drop them specifically from the U.S. version.
2) Usability: numbers are displayed in smaller font, which is harder to read; also the shift functions are painful to read on the black, textured, and somewhat reflective background.

At the same time, the new model has several obvious advantages over fx-115ES PLUS, such as:
1) a much faster processor (which is obvious when calculating integrals)
2) a new ""QR"" feature that can display graphs on your smartphone
3) a new ""OPTN"" button that can save you time
4) a separate ""x"" variable button that saves time
5) improved memory recall feature that shows all variables on one page
6) spreadsheet mode

Compared to the leading scientific calculators made by other brands (most notably Sharp and TI), my biggest pet peeve about Casio is that IT LOSES ALL THE HISTORY AS SOON AS THE POWER IS TURNED OFF. This is by far the biggest reason I stopped using Casio at work. As an engineer, I want to be able to return to the same formula I was working on after my calculator turned off due to inactivity. This should be THE most basic feature for any advanced engineering calculator, and I find it mind-boggling that the Casio marketing keeps ignoring it.

Other very useful and time-saving features that I would really like to see in future Casio calculators are: 1) a way to store and recall a few frequently used formulas, and 2) being able to jump to the beginning and end of the formula, e.g. by pressing Shift-Left and Shift-Right.

At first listen, I thought they sounded pretty nice but a bit too polite.  For the money I paid I was more or less content, but all the while I was thinking that there's no way these speakers are worth their retail price of $595 or $695 (I've seen both prices quoted).  Then something happened...  After a couple of days of listening I thought the speakers were starting to open up and engage me a bit more.  The more I listened the more convinced I became that the sound emanating from these attractive boxes was becoming quite extraordinary.  As a reality check, I directly compared the Aviano 2's with a couple of other bookshelf speakers that I own.  First up was a pair of Definitive Technology StudioMonitor 450's which I have long admired for their sound quality.  The Def Techs sounded unrefined in comparison having a noticeably untidy-sounding midrange and possessing less natural sounding tonal colors, characteristics I had never noticed before.  The next comparison was with my stand-by pair of B&W CDM 2se speakers which I consider one of the most tonally neutral speakers I have ever owned.  Again the comparison favored the Avianos, the B&W's having a more muted, less detailed treble and lacking focus in the midrange (another characteristic I had never noticed before).

Long story short, the Mordant Short Aviano 2's are very attractive speakers that sonically punch well above their price class (they are currently selling for less than $350/pair on the web).  Just make sure your give them a few days break-in before you form your own opinion.",5.0

The points of interest feature constantly points out shopping and services nearby in real time and by name (eg Foodlion, Hampton Inn, Shopping center and so on).
The touch screen works great. I use a retracted ball point pen as I have fat fingers.
To sum up, It is a fantastic unit and I would recommend it to anyone unless you drive in a very noisy enviorment.

I mounted on an exterior wall and was a little concerned about the depth of the retrofit box they use, but it slid right in and locked nicely.  I trimmed about a foot off the the supplied cable and re stripped it.  The only challenge I had, and I removed 1 star due to this, was that the wires did not secure very well, despite cranking the screws down on them.  One of them I actually had to double the wire back on itself to create a snugger fit.  Despite that, I would definitely use this product the next time I mount a TV.",4.0
2791059,"The unit is brand new. I don't think that a VHS recorder should be made without a tuner. I was told by my local store that a cable box would suffice. But my cable box outputs a signal on coaxial (aerial) cable (meaning you need a tuner to tune in to channel 3 to view television). I had to keep an old VHS player (doesn't play or record well) from the thrift store for its tuner (the cable box coaxial cable output is connected to the old VHS recorder which outputs its signal on the three RCA cables which run to the new VHS recorder. The old recorder tunes in to the cable-box out, and outputs the signal to the new Toshiba). I've got a stack of units on top of my television that is threatening to scrape the ceiling.

The unit feels cheap and plastic, not good considering the amount of money this unit costs. Brand new DVD discs skip (fortunately I only bought the unit to play my VHS tapes), and I own a Pioneer DVD player which was cheaper and is far superior - none of my DVD discs skip on the Pioneer. After all this time, some manufacturers (like Toshiba) of DVD players still haven't solved the problem of poor laser alignment. Kudos to Pioneer for getting it right, on my unit at least).

This thing smells like plastic.  Leather has a distinct musty smell to it.  2. scratching.  If you use your fingernail and gently scratch smooth leather, it will scratch.  Try it on a pair of shoes or a handbag.  This Incipio case does not scratch.  3. the underside of leather (the raw side) is a distinct texture.  Find a pair of unlined leather shoes and you will see what I'm talking about.  This Incipio case does not have that.  It has a distinct plastic look to the underside (you'll have to look between the stitching and the elastic on the side of the case to see the underside of what Incipio calls leather.

8827799,"I bought a Lenovo K450 desktop from Amazon and it was delivered on January 22, 2014.  Previous to this purchase I had been using an Alienware with Windows 8.1 and an external USB hard drive by Seagate for my backups.  After I activated my Lenovo and started the process of re-installing all my programs on the K-450 I notices immediately that although my USB Seagate hard drive was recognized under Windows 8.1, It was not recognized by Lenovo's System Backup 4.0 software.  Only the C drive was listed as a backup drive to which I could back up my computer's C drive. It seems incredulous that one would design a machine that only backed up to itself! What would happen if the hard drive failed?  The answer is no backup.
I immediately called Lenovo and much to my shock, they told me their warranty only covered hardware support, not software!  They forwarded me to another telephone number and I was asked to buy ""Premium"" support for my software issue.  I told the tech it was ridiculous to warranty the capacitors, resistors, hard drive and all the other components in the computer but NOT the various software systems that instructed all the hardware components to work.  Imagine buying a car with no instructions on how to operate it or support from the dealer for things that didn't work!  Some business model.
I told them (probably a waste of time but helped me vent a little) that in the 27 years I have been buying computers from Dell, HP, Alienware, Toshiba and all the other companies never had  I been told their warranty only covered the hardware, not the software,,,especially since the software was included by Lenovo as their own, not some third party's.

Does 1280 x 800 (WXGA) video at 30 fps and has an easy setting for various profiles if you wish to step it down to a lower resolution to save drive space when recording. Image quality, zoom and even night vision are very good! The problem I have with it is the configuration settings. As with any IP camera, simply type the IP address in your browser to get the configuration page. Unfortunately you can only export the video to the built in SD card slot or a SAMBA network drive. Well how about a plain old Windows drive or NAS? I mean really? Yes it comes with other software where you can configure it to record to a Windows drive but it is way to bulky, cumbersome and buggy.
UPDATE: Well I decided to use the included software, which is extremely powerful. Newbies will need to read the manual first to understand all of the configuration settings and wizards to set for it to work. I have two of these recording to a Windows NAS server on a business domain. I should also make note that I am using them without the power cords (POE-Power over ethernet). If you do not have a POE switch or router you can use a cheap POE injector such as the TP-Link TL-poe150s. This is another big benefit to this camera. Most places do not have a wall outlet nearby to plug the camera in and if you do, seeing the cord looks cheap and ugly.

6534228,"I am in no way an audiophile - just someone who wanted better than the apple earpods that can with my iphone. That being said these headphones are great and I love the aesthetics of them.

First off, these things were not what I expected right out of the box. Maybe the idea of burning in is a myth, but I let these guys play music at different volume levels for an entire night and the sound improved and continues to improve with use.
I didn't have much experience with over-the-head headphones and when looking at prices and the features I wanted, these fit right in. I would not pay the normal retail price of $100 for these, I got them for around $60 and that's as steep as I would go with these. Another thing about my lack of experience was the worry over how comfortable these guys would be. With the proper adjustment (and some getting used to), they feel fine. I wear glasses and have a cartilage piercing and don't often feel discomfort. Yes, after a few hours (2-3) a break is needed but that's okay with me.
I was also looking for a pair of headphones that wouldn't leak noise and also have the ability to cancel out noise. These are not the best in this area, they definitely leak a bit and they're not the best and canceling out noise. This wasn't a dealbreaker for me though, I guess it depends where you plan on using them and just what volume you listen to them at.
I've read that they creak but I haven't had that problem (I guess I keep my head pretty still when listening?) I also definitely wish they came with a protective case or pouch of some sort.

Overall, I would recommend these, probably to someone who is as much a novice in this area as I am. I have not had many experience with anything besides various cheap earbuds so this was a nice step up for me. The look of these is great- the flat cord, the red detail, the big sony branding on the head band is nice. They fold up which is convenient. I got them at a pretty good price point.

Excuse me for being presumptuous, but it is 2014 and I expect brand-new, out-of-the-box products to work seamlessly. Even if we ignore the fact that neither the device nor setup disk came with the proper drivers (I know, right!?), I shouldn't have to spend 7 hours combing through troubleshooting forums just to invert the frakking axis configuration.

I cannot stress this enough: the software designed for the SpaceMouse Wireless is HORRIBLE. As alluded to previously, the axis configuration is completely counter-intuitive and there are no options to invert or reverse said axis configuration, even though these were standard features on previous releases of the software! There is no guide or manual of any sort to explain how to configure the mouse to your liking (I still have no idea what the ""dominant"" option does); and even if you figure it out, the software DOESN'T SAVE your settings, so the next time you boot up your program you have to completely reconfigure everything AGAIN. Also, the fact that the software doesn't let you map application functions to the buttons is absurd, especially considering the relatively useless functions that are mapped by default.

3364134,"This is my first DSLR. I took some photography classes when I was young and consider myself reasonably proficient in the use of a traditional SLR. For the last 6 years my main camera (and first digital camera) was a Nikon Coolpix 5400, which I bought because it offered some of the features of a DSLR (exposure controls) at a more affordable price. When upgrading, I briefly considered going for another Coolpix model, which undoubtedly would have performed better than my old one in many ways, and would definitely be less expensive than a DSLR, but I decided I really wanted lens interchangeability. I also considered the other non-SLR, interchangeable-lens options in the same price range as the D5000, such as Micro Four Thirds and the new Samsung NX-10. Those would have offered basically everything I was looking for, in a slightly lighter and more compact package, but ultimately I decided to go with the D5000 because it's based on a proven design and has a lot of lens options. I couldn't be happier with my decision.

The most obvious differences compared to my old Coolpix are the outstanding battery life (hundreds of pictures with and without flash and I still haven't run the battery down all the way yet), and the fast autofocus and quick turnaround time. In the past I've missed many good shots of my kids because of the sluggish autofocus on my old camera. Even if you never learn how to use all of the features on this camera and just leave it in auto mode, the picture quality is well worth the extra cost and bulkier camera compared to a compact.

8279942,"Before purchasing this brand, I was considering the Tech Armor brand. I purchased the iSmooth for $12.97 so it's really a great price now for $9.97.

I had wanted the Ultra Clear Screen Protector and not an anti-glare protector because I had wanted the HD on the iPad Air to show through the screen, which it does.  The package comes with two screen protectors, which are not flimsy, but firm screens covered by a thin protective sheet on each side.  It also comes with a cleaning cloth, and dust removal stickers.  The instructions provide a link to view a video for tips and on how to apply the protector.

I have applied screen protectors for my iPod touch and phones. Usually there are bubbles and dust that is just unavoidable, and results in removing and/or shifting the screen protector to fit within the screen.  I found the iSmooth screen protector easy to apply because it wasn't flimsy and I was successful in the first try.  The dust removal stickers are helpful to pick up the dust particles that can unexpectedly fall on the screen while applying.

Other brands usually provide a small cardboard to smooth out the bubbles.  The package did not include one.  I had used one from my screen protector of my smartphone.  This was helpful for me, but other persons may not need to use this.
The only area I encountered bubbles was near the home button, which was easy to get out.

After application, the 2nd sheet is peeled off.  At first the screen protector did not feel smooth, but felt like it had some sort of coating on it.  After a few days, the screen felt smooth and looks like there is no screen protector there at all.  The display screen is clear like the glass - just as the package says ""Ultra Clear"".

They were ordered as ""like new"" and came sans packaging with no manual.  Since the only info I had on these were some decent reviews I contacted MAXELL and got a quick reply from tech support.  I was emailed the front and back side of the packaging which had a lot of good information.  I asked tech support about where the battery/ies went to power the amplification.  Guess what!  The AMPlified headphones weren't actually ""amplified"".  D'Oh!!!

The tech person explained they used extremely large diaphragms, were quite sensitive, and required little volume gain to sound great.  I tried them on the iPad with the latest ""Transformers"" movie and wow!  The audio quality was fantastic and twice as loud as the earbuds from my iPod...

I guess that if ""Discount Giant"" had better specs and description listed I wouldn't have had to contact the manufacturer for info. However; they did arrive in good condition, worked properly, and sounded great.

I would buy from ""Discount Giant"" again having the knowledge that ""like new"" means just that and to not expect packaging and manuals to be included.  Their website and ease of ordering as well as payment and shipping options were quite easily navigated and they do have a vast selection from which to choose.

In closing ""Discount Giant"" seems to be an honest and reliable .com to purchase technology, etc.

12045503,"I bought the Jabra Stealth after my old Platronics headset died. It had very good reviews and I wanted to give it a try. Unfortunately after two weeks of trying to get used to its downsides I call it quits and declare it as a bad buy.
Pros:
* Excellent sound quality. Really, they nailed this part.
* Call volume is awesome even in loud places.
* Great ear fit with a variety of adapters.
Cons:
* Very bad battery life, I don't think it ever truly lasted 6 hours for me.
* No volume control from the headset. This turned out to be the ""concept"" of all current Jabra headphones and I just can't get it. They expect me to control the volume from the phone, but the whole reason I'm using a Bluetooth headset is because I want the phone to be away (e.g. in my bag or pocket when I'm cycling). This makes no sense to me.
* The ""Google Now"" button is often useless when there's no volume control from the headset. I just finished a call that was too loud so I turned the volume down, I want to ask Google something but the volume is now way too low for me to hear the response and there's no way for me to control it until I call someone else and modify the call volume from the phone (or use some volume control app I guess).
(note: in order for the headset to activate Google Now instead of the voice dialer a small patch is needed)
* I found myself surprised several times that the headset is completely out of juice and can't use it at all. All my previous headsets made it very difficult to get to this situation: they announced the estimated talk time when turning on the headset and gave several audio warnings when the battery ran low. The Jabra gives minimal notifications for its state unless you ""ask for it"" (by clicking its main button when it's connected).
* The plastic feels cheap and the USB cover doesn't look like it's built to last but maybe I'm just being picky here.",2.0

19987324,"The beginning with this device was not great - the one I got had defunct headphone outputs on both plugs. Thanks to Amazon, I received a new one. The purpose of my purchase was to enable Dolby Digital Live Encoding through the optical/SPDIF out for my Sonos (which can only receive 5.1 surround, and no DTS etc). Well, this does NOT work since the optical out signal is not DDL, and will only transfer Stereo with the enhanced SBX. Normally I would have returned the device. However, the SBX protocol works surprisingly well with my Sonos, and the sound from my TV apps, Plex and PS4 is (digitally) remarkably improved. It might not be the proper 5.1 sign, but it is still worlds better than before, and the SBX gives me a better sound space.
The device also functions as a nice DAC and gives me a nice sound signal for my audiophile headphones. The only thing I wish was that the output of 300ohm (there are two settings - low impedance and high impedance) would be even more flexible - since my headphones have an impedance of only 22, this still seems rather high.
Overall, I would really rate this as a 3.5 star device, since some minor annoyances are definitely there : As said, no transmission of a true 5.1 signal, no USB input port for attaching a microphone, and a very, very sluggish app if connected via bluetooth are annoyances, but it really improved myself sound.",4.0

8806420,"This review is for the High Sierra AT7 Rolling Backpack with zip-off daypack!

I took this roller carry-on backpack on a three week trip to Ecuador which involved three flights each way. It was great that it was carry-on size and that I could wheel it through airports. Once I landed it underwent a lot of rigorous handling: on and off buses, taxis, tossed into the back of pickup trucks, etc. I wheeled it down sidewalks and cobblestone streets and only used the backpack straps a few times - once staying in a primitive lodge in the Amazon where I had to climb a dirt, rocky path for half a mile and on a few other occasions to take it up flights of stairs. The backpack straps worked well for short hauls like these, but are not meant for the Inca Trail.
On my outbound flights I packed the daypack and put it inside the main roller bag, along with other items, and took another hiking daypack that had proper shoulder, sternum, and waistbelt straps that was my personal item on these flights. I did not want to risk lost luggage so didn't check anything.
On my return flights I had the High Sierra zip-off daypack as my personal item and the roller luggage as my carry-on. The other hiking daypack went inside a duffle bag that I had purchased and had to be checked (full of souvenirs and gifts).
While in Ecuador I went to the Amazon (hot and humid), the central highlands where it was cool and rainy, the beach - hot!, and the Andes where it was quite cool and I had to layer my clothing to stay warm. The High Sierra luggage held a lot. I had enough clothing, plus hiking shoes, sandals, water shoes, umbrella, toiletries and everything I thought I would need including electronic devices. The luggage served me well and held everything I needed for a three week adventure in various climates. When you have to transport your stuff everyday you become very aware of your load. If anything, I brought too much stuff!

Did a lot of research before buying this detector; learned what the most popular radar in use was in the areas I travel, and discovered this detected it among the best detectors. There are some very poor performing detectors, some for much more than this one costs. You can certainly spend in this range for other detectors and be very disappointed.

Its range is not necessarily ""better"" than a $400-650 detector, but in many cases, depending on the radar in use, it is competitive. It shines in eliminating ""falses"" as good or better than any, including the most expensive in that range.

This mount is just the right size to accommodate it (VESA 400 x 400), cover it completely, and more importantly, in the event I upgrade the TV in size, the mount shouldn't have to be replaced. I wound up paying someone to put this up for me and they did it pretty seemingly. It's very easy to adjust the tilt - just need to grab the TV and go up and down (and it can move left and right too).

Since I need the camera ASAP, I went to Best Buy and purchased a slightly larger yet compatible battery size (about 50bucks!). The camera works fine. The quality is good enough for my purposes. I filmed karate classes in a large well lit gym.
The software that comes with the camera was a pain in the neck to install and virtually worthless for editing.

MY RATING SYSTEM:
I try to stick with the same criteria and system when reviewing products and here is how it breaks down
FIVE STARS:  Great Product, would feel completely confident in recommending to others and consider the product to be a great overall value with no obvious faults.
FOUR STARS:  Still a very good product, I consider it to be overall a good satisfying purchase and can still recommend it in good faith but there is one small aspect about the product keeping it from a perfect score.
THREE STARS:  A good product but not a great one, it operates and appears as advertised but more than one aspect of the item is undesirable.  This is an item I would use but probably consider an alternative option.
TWO STARS:  Product is definitely lacking in quality and or the way it operates.  Would not recommend it to others and would seek and alternative elsewhere.  It maybe just barely does what it is advertised to do but is probably not worth the money and there are many negative factors about it.
ONE STAR:  No two ways about it, this is a bad product and I would not recommend anybody purchase it.",5.0

The microphone just died. It doesn't work live or by USB in any configuration on any computer. Extremely disappointed in how long this microphone lasted. And it's out of it's return window now, so there's nothing I can do about it. Do extensive testing immediately after purchasing this microphone and return it if there is any hint of a problem.

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************

The microphone itself is great! I use it live with an XLR input on a regular basis, and plug it into an audio interface for my computer as well. However, there are a few quirks with it.

-The USB wire that comes with it is shoddy. It's flimsy and very finicky with when it wants to work. I have to use the XLR output.
-In the same line of thought, the headphone port is strangely placed at the bottom of the mic, and it feels cramped since there are so many other interfaces there.
-The volume control affects your computer's volume, not the input volume (which is expected, but just a head's-up), but is useless with the XLR input I have been relegated to using.

Connectivity problems aside, the quality is excellent, and the construction is durable. The stand is a bit short, and doesn't rotate very freely, but the  microphone itself is a great budget microphone for anyone needing high-quality audio input at a cheap price.",2.0

It is sleek and stylish despite its generic form.  (Yes, it would easily switch between right and left hands.)

I like it because my hand easily adapts to using it--even when my hand has just come off a much larger mouse (like my Logitech Performance Mouse MX.)  This mouse is 3 3/4"" long x 2 1/4"" at its widest point near the palm and 2 1/8"" at its narrowest point near your fingertips.  It slopes up to 1 1/4"" high where it hits the top of your palm.

It moves quickly, without drag, when it is not on  a mouse pad.  Put it on a mouse pad and your hand will work harder to move it around.

Definitely LOVE the way Dell has ingeniously used tiny magnets under the cover to hold the top and bottom together.  You just lift/pull apart with just a touch of pressure and the top comes off to access the batteries.

I went to the Encore web site and downloaded then installed the most current Win 7 drivers. I then used windows update which gave me a more current driver but this time from Realtek. In my device manager under network adapters it stated that this adapter was Realtek RTL8192CE. So I went to the Realtek web site and downloaded the RTL8192CE-VA4 driver for Win 7.

16292447,"This router simplifies what has always been a complicated process for those of us not very knowledgeable about Modems and Routers and networks. The set-up process is easy as can be, follow the three simple instructions, you may have to reset the Modem which, again, is easy, and it starts working right away.

The touch-screen display is great, providing easy-to-understand information about the network at the touch of your fingers. You can see how many devices are on and how much data each device is using. It also gives a health rating that informs you whether your network is healthy and strong or whether its getting bogged down by too many devices doing too many things.

Using the Starry App on my smart phone gives me more control over the product and is just a smart, simple way to control it. No more typing in the browser trying to get into your Router's settings.

Overall, it's worth the high cost as it basically puts all other routers to shame in regards to User Interface and Accessibility. It's wireless strength is also great, as I can now stream videos from the bedroom which I could not with the old router.",5.0

 They sound pretty great for the price. Treble, mids, and bass are all fairly neutral sounding. Some people may not like this, but I personally don't mind. I do wish these had a bit more bass at times though. However, that can also depend on what tips you use and how good the fit is.
Echoing what most others say, the included Comply tips were the most comfortable and best sounding, while they lasted. Mine only lasted a bit more than a month before they began tearing, but your mileage may vary. Other than the Comply tips, I found the shorter double-flange tip to be a fairly comfortable fit as well. But of course that's different for every person.
I also love all the included accessories. I use the carrying case every day and it does a solid job of protecting. The extra wire with the mic is a big plus if you're using these with a phone like I am. The 1/4 adapter is also a plus if you find yourself needing that.

When the machine arrived, i unboxed it, and something was wrong. It took me a few minutes but I realized it was the wrong computer. I did some checking and the machine was somewhat comparable. So I decided it wasn't worth the time spent to get it replaced.

I then tried to install ESET, one of the better Anti Virus programs out there, and that is where things got bad. Upon Install, I got a blue screen of death. Reloaded, and it went into a Boot Loop where it Blue Screen of Death'd every boot. So I recovered the machine with the MSI Image. I tried 3 times to install eset, and each time the machine crashed.

Assuming ESET was not compatible with Windows 10 I tried Kaspersky, and again, the same issues occured. This time the blue screen failure was different, but it still blue screened. I recovered the machine, and did some checking, found an antivirus called Comodo. Installed it on a freshly recovered hard drive, and Comodo found a Virus. I cleaned the virus, but on a hunch, I did the same MSI Factory Reset I had been doing, and then installed Comodo First thing, and ran a Virus scan. Sure enough, the Virus was in the exact same location.

Yup, the MSI Recovery Image, and likely the Operating System from the first boot, had a virus. Who does this? Who ships a computer with a virus?

I downloaded all the Drivers to the second hard drive, and the MSI Utilities, then formatted the C Drive and reinstalled Windows 10 from an ISO image I downloaded.

My desk, my car, by my shower, by my kitchen sink when washing dishes..Ive got them everywhere. Just saying that I like this mount & I know what I like because Ive tried enough that I don't like. Heres a few of the reasons.

Its got a solid, strong magnet. Its unbelievable how many makers skimp on this basic requirement and leave me picking my phone off the floorboard after a bump. Not this one. I just got it but i got it for my girlfriend and if it can withstand just an hour of her driving than it can withstand anything.

The joint between the base and the magnet is moveable but stiff. My phone is an iPhone 7 Plus with a case so it is heavier than many phones and that causes it to pull the magnet itself to the lowest facing position. I can not stand driving and trying to pull my phone up from looking at the floorboard so I can put a playlist on. I drove my girlfriends car today, it had no issues with my iPhone.  yay

It has nice pad to buffer your phone from the magnet when you throw it on the mount. I had one mount that worked great but the padding was basically nonexistent and it dinged the back of my phone up.

The 120 Hz is not just hoopla, you can really see the difference especially when playing games or watching fast paced movies with a lot of split second action. Of course the 1080p is great. If you hook a Cat-5 (Ethernet/LAN) cable to it (yes its got an Ethernet port!!) it'll let you read news, weather updates and stock through live feeds. The TV speakers are good enough (trust me they can get loud!) to be used by themselves in case you want to wait for sometime until you get a home theater or something. The remote is good but for a couple of flaws. I love the illuminated keys button which makes all the keys on the remote glow with just the right light. Very useful when watching movies in the dark, keeps you from tilting the remote is various directions to get that light bouncing off something so you can reading what you're pressing.

The picture looks great! I've used it with my xbox 360 and is it great or what! 4 HDMI ports are great and the placement is good. The 1 port on the side panel is great to plug in your laptop or something. It also has a USB port which you can connect to any mass storage device (external Hard Disk, Portable Hard Disk or even a pendrive). The TV plays mp3s, movies and images (most formats) directly from the media. You can even connect a wireless adapter (sold by samsung) to enable the live content I mentioned before.

Dell has put a great panel and a wonderful bezel together with the buggiest firmware I've ever encountered in a consumer product. Additionally, the firmware is not user-upgradable.

It fails to handshake or, when it does, does a weird half-screen thing where only the right half of the panel shows video.

The greatest surprise I had with this keyboard is that it works very well with my Dell Venue Pro 8 Windows 8.1 Tablet.  I have an IVSO case on my Dell Tablet and when I fold it with the stand in portrait mode I can easily rest the tablet on the keyboard and use it like a laptop.  The raised back of the keyboard prevents the Venue Pro 8 from tipping over.  There is still a slight chance it will tip if I hold it at extreme angles but in most angles the tablet is perfectly stable.  This has added immeasurable usability to my Venue Pro 8 Tablet.

*** Positive Points: ***

- Very good protection for iPad Air
- Works with all other Bluetooth devices including Windows and Android
- Backlit keys are a big help in dark conditions and the ability to change the Backlight color is great
- Very Long Battery Life
- Has an LED to indicate battery status and pairing
- Micro USB charging

*** Negative Points: ***

- Included instructions are not very thorough
- Packaging was VERY DIFFICULT to open
- Hard to know what the battery level is until it gets low (an LED battery meter would help)

Its connects instantaneously to my Apple products by Bluetooth. I have other speakers but this is my favorite. I have a Marley speaker that I also like a lot but is over twice the price. I find the sound to be great on both but this one has a little more bass and depth. To me, the Marley has more clarity when listening to music at higher volumes, but I prefer the Jam when listening to movies at normal sound levels. I'm not an audiophile but to my ear the Marley sounds like it has more treble and the Jam XT more bass.  Either is a great choice but the Jam XT is awesome, it's become my favorite of all my speakers for using with my iPad Mini and watching movies/TV and the price is so reasonable (especially when on sale for 29.99). Also, I never have connection issues with the Jam XT. The Jam XT is so portable as its light enough to hook onto a backpack or toss in a purse (though I but wouldn't want to carry it in my purse everyday). I have a  little Brookstone that weighs next to nothing and produces decent sound but not as rich. My least favorite is the iHome speaker which is super lightweight like the Brookstone but has the lowest quality sound of the four I own and I never end up using it. I highly recommend Jam XT for great rich wireless sound at a reasonable price and perfect connectivity. The other quality I love in the Jam XT is I get more than 8 hours without needing to charge it and generally only need to charge it once a week.

Movies stream very well too, but some hi res HD files sometimes stall with a message saying the ""network performance being insufficient - buffering"".  This has not happened often.  Some AVI files are not compatible, for instance from My Nikon d90 - they have to be converted to a compatible format.  Getting Sub titles to work with movies has not always worked.

The HDMI conversion is by far one of its best features.
Its slide show feature for pictures is sometimes a little slow if the files are big, which tends to be the case from newer digital cameras, otherwise works well.

4336314,"So let's start with why I purchased this case. I had bought a Wifi Kindle to replace my Nook as I travel with it quite a bit due to my job. I had also bought the expensive case with a built in light to kind of protect it from the occasional drop or bang. Well, lets just say the the expensive case looked nice but didn't protect as well as I was hoping! after two minor falls from less than 4 feet, my old Kindle was banged up and the screen was missing about 2MM of display at the top! So I relegated my old kindle to my wife, and bought a new one with this case and the M-edge light that was recommended for this case. After about 3 weeks of pretty heavy use here are my impressions.

Pros: The case is well made and looks good. It does protect the Kindle more than the more expensive Amazon case. The pocket does hold the standard charger and cord without too much of a bulge, but the bulge is noticable. The M-edge light does slip into the pocket that was designed for it and it holds stays put, but it sticks out too much for my taste (see cons) Once you open the case you can flip the top half all the way around and zip it back up which holds the flaps securely, and gives you the feel of an actual book bulk wise, without the added weight. It looks like it will protect the Kindle well, but I have not put it to the test yet. I am sure I will before too long though!

Cons: M-edge light sticks out from the case, Very unwieldy, but lights up the screen well. It would be nice to have zipper handles on both the inside and outside for zipping it up as described above. Pockets are small, but that is a minor issue.

Impression: All in all it is a good case for those of us who consistently fail to care for our Kindle as well as we should. It is well built, reasonably priced, and looks good. Well worth the money.",4.0

1886151,"This is one of the fastest USB drives I've ever owned.  But what's really important to me is the size.  There are other drives out there that perform slightly faster than this one but they are all fat and bulky and hard to use with adjacent usb ports.  This is the slimmest USB drive I've seen, yet its still amazingly fast and durable.  It's not infinitely durable - mine finally died after 9 months of heavy use, but that's still nearly a record for me because it represents about 100 drops onto concrete and a few runs through the clothes washer along with some serious freezing weather.  :)

If it's any consolation, once mine died I did a hard search of all possible alternatives, and ended getting the exact same one again, mostly because no other high speed drives have this slim form factor.  The 64GB supposedly has faster write speeds, but Amazon doesn't seem to carry it at this time.

UPDATE:  I just got my replacement, and it's the one with the newer controller chip and the blue light (vs the old orange light.)  I basically use my drive as a floppy disk, and I found this new controller results in faster reads but much slower writes.  I do a representative test by reading and writing a single, 8GB file: (this is on a 17"" MBP)

Write speed - 13.60 MB/second (9 minutes, 19 seconds)
Read speed - 30.53 MB/second (4 minutes, 9 seconds)
Avg (read+write)/2 = 22 MB/second (13 minutes, 28 seconds)

The read speed is incredible - about as fast as a USB 2.0 external hard drive, but the write speed is slow enough that on average, this drive is a bit slower than my old one.  The new controller might explain why we're seeing more performance drives now with very slow write speeds.

The slower write speed is disappointing, but I'm still over all pretty happy with it - it's still among the higher performing drives out there.",5.0

But so is the stuff that I'm too tired to drive over to purchase at the local office supply store that costs much less.  Then there's the gasoline, the time, and the energy taken to go over there that must be weighed against the handiness of this being delivered to my home, and all I have to do is carry it up the stairs.  If it outlasts what I got at the office supply store last time, then it will be worth the $17.53 instead of the $8,00 + gasoline + time + wear and tear (on me and the car) + the bother of it all.

It is discreet enough that people wouldn't look at you and notice it unless they know what they are looking for (or like one person had it and recognized mine). The volume at full blast is just loud enough that people near you can hear it faintly. If you have the speakers positioned right over your ears most other sound is drowned out but it is definitely not noise cancelling. The speakers also have good sound quality overall.

Now to my 'Buts'...

This hat seems a bit small. Throughout the day I constantly have to tug it back down over my ears and when I was wearing it while working outside it slid up so often that I just let it sit higher up on my head.

Also, if you live somewhere extremely cold the speakers may fizzle in and out - people who have worn headphones in sub zero temps understand what I'm talking about.

Lastly, I just have an issue with the button selections. I really wish that there were more than 3 buttons and that there was a power saving mode - say if your phone wasn't connected to the bluetooth that it would turn off after 5 minutes or so. I accidentally let my hat die a couple times :(

This thing is really quiet, and it only takes up the space of one slot in my PCI and AGP slot groupings, so that is pretty cool.  The big bad Ultra version (as opposed to GT) takes up 2 slots, and it needs two molex power supply connectors.  It was also easy to install in my Windows XP-driven box, and I actually have SP2 installed.  Take it out of the box, handle carefully, and insert into your AGP slot.

For me these are in the sweet spot of price to performace as the seem to pack 80-90% of the top and close to top headphones I listened to, for 10-20% of the price.

Very clear and detailed, able to handle complex pieces of music without strain, excellent vocal representation, pleasant sparkle and enough umph in the bass to go around without spoiling the rest of the tune. Good spacial separation. (I listen mostly to vocal, jazz, classical, opera, mostly loseless CD rips / FLAC from a computer-to-LH GO 450 dac/amp. They benefit from the dac/amp in terms of increased clarity but otherwise are very easy to drive from the iphone or computer jack).

I read about the tape removing mod on the internet and got curious at first but ended up not doing it - I like the current sound and don't feel the need for more trebble, particularly at the cost of looser lows.

Built quaity is great for the intended purpose - home listening. Entierely plastic, of the good quality sort, they inspire confidence in many years of service with minimal care but definitely not shock proof as some of the studio headphones I tried. Very light and comfortable - earpads are awesome! - and while the fit is snug, its easy to foget I have them on. They are fairly well ventilated and don't get too warm as closed headphones tend to do.

As many others pointed out, these are open headphones and the sound will leak in and out profusely. This is a design choice trading better sound quality and spacial cues for isolation and thus not a defect. These are not a good choice for commuting and traveling due to lack of sound isolation, size/non foldable, non bomb proof build.

I am very happy with these - I only regret not getting them a while back.  ( I discarded them initially without  listening, as probably not good enough, due to the low price and the internet hype for more expensive models.

My only reservations about it are the somewhat poky response time that means you often miss an action shot -- though this seems to be something common to cameras that aren't either DSLRs, expensive or both. The other reservation I have has to do with the build quality ... the casing feels like it's a plastic model of a camera and the battery door is iffy. The latch, which is not sprung, will eventually loosen up and slide out of ""lock"" at the slightest provocation and the next thing you know, your batteries are on the ground 50 feet behind you. I've taken to covering the little tiny latch slider with a small square of duct tape once I lock it. Makes it a tiny bit of a pain when you want to get the card out for downloading, as the card is inside the battery door as well. I like this camera; an improved battery door latch (it wouldn't even have to be the entire door!) would make me like it a lot more.
EDIT: I just discovered a little kluge that makes the latch work better. The latch itself is a little plastic tab that's held to the inside of the battery door by one of the battery contact strips. It's the U-shaped one that's held in place by three screws. I removed the contact strip and put a small -- like an eighth of an inch square -- piece of thin duct tape on the back of the strip where it sits over the latch tab. That provides just enough friction that the latch stays where you put it and doesn't just slide out of place at the slightest jar.",4.0

- However, the angle of this unit is terrible! I even use it with the gel support that is included, but after a couple of hours of use I get wrist pain from using the unit. The whole reason for buying a trackball is to eliminate wrist movement, so in this respect the mouse is a failure.

I believe that Kensington makes a slim-line trackball version and I wish I had gone with that version instead as the angle looks much different.

For the price, you really get a lot of TV. This tv's picture quality is one of the best out there. I have been researching LCD Tv's for months now and this one stands out the most. I was torn between this model and the Sony 46V3000 and I finally was able to see them side by side and their  pictures were almost exactly the same. I could barely notice that the Sony had a little deeper color but only on certain pictures. So when the price dropped to $1499.98 on Amazon I jumped on this TV and have not been disappointed.

I would say the some fast moving motion is a little blurred and not a crisp as the Samsung 46a650 with the 120hz refresh and Auto motion plus but I don't feel like I am missing that. Like most people, I agree that that sound on this TV is not very good and takes some adjusting in the settings. After making the adjustments, the sound is much better. My Xbox 360 looks amazing on this TV and I don't notice any trailing or blurring or anything when playing Call of Duty or Madden.

If I had smaller screens, then maybe the size of the foot wouldn't be such a big deal, because I could swing the monitors closer together and thus further out from the stand.

Lastly the pivots where the monitors attached had a bar (stop?) on them so that you couldn't spin the screens around very far, I think they only went about 75-80%. This wasn't far enough for my needs, so I took an angle grinder to it and removed these stops, a little flat black paint later and I was all set.

Ultimately I am going to drill a hole through the desk and attach the stand that way, doing away with the foot. Also I need to get at the hinges with the included wrench and tighten up the right side pivot, as the monitor keeps tilting down, but that is a basic adjustment I cannot ding them for.",4.0

This was in a area away from any hills, mountains etc. I have also used 5 watt Midland radios in the mountains where the signal was sent mountain to mountain with no obstructions and was able to transmit and receive signals for maybe 5 miles at most.

7059828,"This product was purchased as a gift for my daughter's fifth birthday at a friends suggestion. The game is a physical add on to an iPad app and requires the player to find the required train card and insert it into a slot to move on to the next step in the game. My daughter seems to enjoy playing with it, but I don't see a lot of repeat play coming up when she's finished with the games. It definitely seems like it's more appropriate for a younger child, but at the same time I'm not a big fan of electronic gadgets for 3 year olds. One game involves taking the train cars (all characters from the show) and placing them 10 giant steps away. Then the station calls out ""go get Thomas"" and the child has to go seek out that card and bring it back and plug it into the station in a certain amount of time. So it's requiring them to get up and move, which is good. But, the issue here is, unless your child is a Thomas fanatic and has all the train faces memorized, they need to be able to read to know which card is which. So an adult ends up having to play (defeating the purpose of most iPad usage--which is to distract your child while you get something else done). It would also be nice if the games were multiplayer. There is a big difference between YOU telling your kids to take turns, and the game actually calling them player one and player two.
So, the GOOD: adds physical interaction to an iPad game and is a cute idea if you're a HUGE Thomas fan
The NOT SO GOOD: limited games that are single player only, and they don't seem to change them up at all. The train relay game calls the trains out in the same order each time.
The BAD: This game costs over $30 and with the free app that you download you only get two games. There is a third locked game and it costs money to play it. For $30 plus dollars it should come with MORE than 3 games, for multiple players, and they shouldnt cost anything extra.",3.0

I've used no small number of these cables in the past, particularly to connect Bluetooth devices to non-Bluetooth ones (such as speakers) and bad cables cause a lot of problems including low volume from an imperfect connection or poor quality components and/or constant static. Having a good cable really makes an enormous difference. I tested this with an iPod, iPad, and iPhone with a a Bluetooth speaker that I've had problems with while using cheaper cabling in the past. It worked seamlessly and there was perfect quality sound. Volume was loud and there was no noise on the line. The connection on both ends was secure.

Physically, the tips of this are metal with gold connectors which gives it the look and feel of being solid. The flat wire doesn't twist as easily and lies against surfaces without inviting tangles. I think the flat cable should reduce the chances long term of internal breakage, and the metal tips should make it unlikely that the casing on the tips will crack or loosen.

5880155,"Okay, in my attempt to keep things simple in any and all future reviews I must first state that: I always dissed computer audio. I am an audiophile and why anyone would want or need more than 2 speakers was beyond me. However I have always known that you usually do, get what you pay for. I do not believe that cables ( Kimber, Cardas, Pangea, ect.) have to cost several hundreds of dollars either.  But, I have been using AudioQuests Evergreen and Cinnamon cables for over a year. I purchased this cable specifically to use with the Dragonfly DAC I acquired and I am very, very happy with my purchase. I run the RCA's to the CD input of my receiver and use my laptop as a ""CD' player through the Dragonfly. This combo sounds so good that I have been burning my vinyl to computer audio files (100 Sinatra albums so far) and I did a test with much cheaper cables. Now, some of you will say that 35 bucks for a cable is outrageously expensive but you'd be wrong. If you are using powered speakers or like myself a receiver to listen to your stored files buy AudioQuest's  mini-2.0M to RCA to feed the music to your exterior system. I could tell the difference between the Monster RCA's and the Evergreen's a year ago and I still can. My phono, (Project Debut Carbon), my CD player, NAD (C546BEE), are both connected with Evergreen's as well. Just try it yourself, if you have any doubts.  My equipment is not 'high end' and I do now have a 7.2 system in my listening space, as a surround sound installer I know that good cables improve sound and vision.  Would the AQ's Golden Gate 3.5 Mini-RCA (100 bucks) sound better than the Evergreen's? I would think so but I really don't care, the Evergreens are outstanding with any and all analog recordings that I have listened to in the past year and I see no need to upgrade, unless I hit the Lotto and can afford that 20,000 system I lust for.

I purchased a Konica Minolta Dimage Z3 through Amazon because 1) My Z2 was accidentally damaged and QBE insurance would only pay me the written down value. That value corresponded to a camera offered by QBE that was inferior to my Z2. Traps for young beginners! I declined the QBE offer and elected instead to find a Konica Minolta elsewhere and pay any 'overcharge"".2)Konica Minolta is no longer available in Australia because a Japanese company has bought them out and replaced the KM with their own brand. Elsewhere in the world Konica Minolta is still available. The Dimage series is a top camera for the amateur in my opinion,and I have had consistently good results from the Z2
I found the later model Z3 (anti-shake)on Amazon and by paying a few dollars above the insurance offer (basically the cost of airfreight and insurance) found I could land the Z3 here within my budget. Despite the fact that Amazon indicates on several of their sites that they do not undertake the forwarding of cameras internationally, they do point out that although 'they' dont, some of their suppliers do. In fact that is what happened. I bought through Amazons' supplier...'Electronics Club'. I bought the camera on Friday Western Australian time and followed its progress with the UPS tracking system over the weekend. It was quite a journey, but the transhipment from one aircraft to another could not be faulted. Rarely more than a few hours via US West Coast then Canada,Korea,Hongkong,Philippines,Singapore and finally Perth in Western Australia.

Pros:
-Durable- I am not easy on headphones and these are holding up very well
-amazing sound- I think even better than my old Bose headphones
-Good length wire
-Good inline mic
-Nice little carry bag, use it all the time
-Amazing noise isolation even with standard tips (very important to me)

Cons:
-because of the fabric coating the wire, when it rubs on something like clothing, noise can travel to you, generally if it is off (sometimes I use headphones as ear plugs)
- Standard silicone tips are just that. Didn't love them for working out because they got very sweaty.
-no inline volume control

I'd give it five stars if it came with wiring codes, but it doesn't. I had to research them from their site. All colors are normal except the tweeters and subwoofer (if you have Premium System). The Yellows with stripes are for tweeters, the white/red strip and green/white stripe are for the sub. In my case I didn't use the factory sub, but used the tweeters which I had to wire to my front speaker cables on the harness as my aftermarket deck is not equipped for this many speakers.

The 07 Coupe Si's amp is in front of the shifter under the console, Sedan is under the drivers seat.

 At first sight, I thought it could be slimmer. Then when I held it in my hand, it felt quite comfortable. Later more logic kicks in: this is a 6x30 scope.

Taotronics,

I can't tell you how much I love my BH07 Bluetooth headphones... which is why it's so upsetting that they stop working 17 minutes into my workout.  As soon as a single drop of sweat touches the buttons on the controller they stop working and lose sync with my phone.  Turning the unit off and on to reset gives me a purple light.  The headset begins to work again once completely dry.  Is there a way I can swap these out with BH06?

Thanks,

Hi,

Thanks for your email, here is how to reset the BH06:

1. Plug the charging cable to the charging port to charge the earphone
2. At the same time press & hold the MFB of the earphone for 3 seconds.
3. You can see the earphone flashes purple 3 times.
4. You can just pair the earphone with your cell phone just like after the factory.

Wish that would help.

The keyboard delay is so annoying. Walk away from the computer long enough for the screen saver to come on and you'll have to wait 20-30 seconds before the keyboard returns.

Also, if the USB keyboard is unpluged for any reason an annoying ""chirp"" begins and will not shut up...even if you unplug the power it.

The purchase process:
1) I purchased a great deal through 6ave, $1200 shipped & no taxes.
2) The TV arrived via freight forwarder & local logistics delivery company that brought the TV into my home and I had to inspect the screen before I signed off and they could leave.

- Works wonderfully with my Time Warner Motorola HD DVR cable box using HDMI. Now only if I more HD channels to watch...
- Works even better with Movies. I have a Toshiba A3 HD-DVD Player connected via HDMI and the picture is just unbelievable! Blacks are beautiful and the colors are vivid.

My concerns before the purchase and now after breaking it in:
1) Anti-glare screen: at first I read mixed reviews. I love it. It truly does an AMAZING job of taking the reflections off the screen in a living room with various types of light. I think the best comparison is a LCD monitor. It has that same ""flatness"" to it that allows you to enjoy what's on the screen rather than the screen itself. I do not miss the glass effect!
2) Burn-in effect: Haven't noticed it yet so I can't even comment! Not an issue...
3) Brightness vs LCDTVs: this TV is perfectly bright. I don't even have it in Vivid mode and I think it's much better than the OVERLY bright LCDTVs I have seen in people's homes.

Now, my other one is fine, and I will probably chalk it up to my fater being a bit too rough on it.  The other problem is much more annoying, and is present on BOTH of my mice.  The problem is with the scroll wheel.  The wheel has a tendency to ""stick"" between knotches causing the screen to jump up and down erratically.  It is very difficult to use the wheel without this problem popping up.  I have never had this problem with ""quality"" scroll mice, only cheap ones.  I think Kensington cut corners on it's design.  On the other hand, their WIRELESS Pocketmouse resolved both of my issues and is a FANTASTIC mouse.",2.0
18633859,"So I've used a number of antennas with my HP-1. UBC3000XLT, and BC125AT and gotten so so results. I received stations up to 60 + air miles away. Not bad considering being in such a rural area. I placed this discone in the 2nd floor attic of my office and what a difference. I continued to receive the stations as before BUT the number of distant stations tripled ! The radius has now increased to 70 air miles that I can receive. Both digital and analog stations are quite clear.  A bit of tweaking and there is no telling what I'll get. BTW the coax is very pliable and that is good since I hate stiff coax

UPDATE: After several months and comparing this antenna to another (Antenna Craft ST-2) I can say  it preforms. SInce I first installed it in the attic of my office I've add a couple of new radios. Added HP-2( using AT125, UBC 3000XLT, HP-1) and I've gotten into SDR, AirSpy and SpyVerter. The SDR works well (vhf side ) very well with it too... it's just a good antenna.

The converter defaults to sending audio through hdmi and refuses to allow you to get your audio through either of the ports specifically for that purpose. However I was able to connect a aux to rca to my monitor that takes the hdmi. I then connected this to my amplifier. This is the workaround I've used.

18363134,"Update:  After using this KVM switch for a few weeks I wanted to update my review.  I can not recommend this product.  I have not used other USB KVM switches, but I have used plenty of PS/2 KVM switches.  I was expecting the same level of consistent operation I have received from GOOD PS/2 KVM switches.  This unit does NOT provide that experience.  I find that frequently when switching between PC's there is a 5 second lag while the PC loses then reconnects the USB mouse and keyboard.  Very annoying when switching back and forth several times in the span of a few minutes.  There have also been times where it has completely stopped working and I had to remove both USB connections from the PCs in order to remove power from the device.  Once it was reset in this manner it would start working again.  I plan to try a Belkin or IOGear unit next because this thing causes regular frustration.

I got mine at Fry's Electronics and it came with a PS/2 version of the manual instead of the USB version.  The manual would only have been useful for telling met the hotkey sequence which turns out is not the same as the PS/2 version so that was a problem.  The PPA Int'l web site doesn't have the manual posted either so through trial and error, I figured out that one hotkey switch sequence is [SCROLL LOCK][SCROLL LOCK] [1 or 2], where the number 1 or 2 is used to select the port you want to view.  I also emailed PPA Int'l who responded very quickly to let me know that [SCROLL LOCK][SCROLL LOCK] [LEFT/RIGHT ARROW KEY] is the hotkey sequence.",1.0

12548081,"The headphone works as described.

pros:
1. The sound quality is great when the noise cancellation is on. The volumne is higher when the switch is on and bass, mid and high are pretty clear. However, when the noise cancellation is off, the sound quality is much worse, even worse than the 10$ headphone and 8$ earphones I have.
2. The noise cancellation works. I think several aspect contribute to it. The ear cup will block a lot of ambient noise. There seems a circuit to cancel some low frequency noise. The volumne also goes up when the switch is on, which make the noise sounds smaller.
3. The price is probably the lowest you can find for a active noise cancellation headphone. The price should be between $35 to $60.
4. It includes a sony battery and an adaptor for split inputs of left and right.

cons:
1. The headphone is on ear headphone. The earcups are too close to each other and the the headphone arm is pretty stiff, so the earcups put fair amount of pressure on my ear. My ear start to hurt after about 2 hours with it.
2. The arm is plastic, and there is no pedding or soft band between the plastic arm and your head. It compress the top of my head and cuase some pain.
3. The sound is poor when the switch is off.
4. The noise cancellation seems only work for some low frequency noise.
5. No carrying bag/case.

Without this app I would have sent it back, but now that I have it is definitely worth keeping. The app that I am using for android is called hint2search. This app is pretty cool because it will unlock your phone from sleep even with a screen lock on. The app is $1.50 and really make this combo a winning one.

Other things I like about it.
Non-connected USB plug rather than an attached plug. I routed this to a spot on my dash from the back seat cigarette lighter rather than clutter my head unit with cords. I tucked the cable underneath my center console trim near the floor. I had to use a usb extension cable to make this work.

But I had to be patient and wait. Took a day off of work to zero my new scope-couldnt wait.
Once received it was package just as the 1-6 x 24 Styrka scope I purchased about a year ago (Repeat customer) very professional packaging.
Mounted my new scope on my Remington AAC-SD 308 rifle using my existing low mounts that I had my Vortex scope mounted to and headed out to a private range I belong to in Manuta Utah (BEWF).
Before any required adjustments, after firing three rounds I was pleased to find that I was about 2MOA to the left of bullseye but aligned level to target. The first three shots were grouped in a 1moa circle. Not bad for an old guy with failing eyes..
Once dialed in I was hitting everything I aimed at in a 1 moa pattern. If only BEWF range was set up for targets out further then 100 meters.
As I stated above, I am a repeat customer. I still have the 1-6 scope mounted on my custom 556 rifle and it is my favorite scope- well maybe - except now I have a 2.5-15 x 50 scope mounted to my 308 that I need to spend some time with.

2449236,"I purchased the GoPro Handlebar mount after borrowing a friends GoPro mount. I think the mount is relatively easy and intuitive to use. It's simple construction allows the user to mount the GoPro to a ski pole or long, cylindrical shaft for active one-handed filming. I made the mistake of leaving the mount on the pole without the GoPro on the mount during a run and knocked the small, metal nut off the end that the GoPro slides into. I was fairly warned by my friend before leaving the mount on that the nut would fall off naturally from the wear and tear of downhill skiing if the GoPro wasn't connected to them mount and foolishly disregarded his advice. I ended up take the nut of the alternative mount with a bit of tampering and jerry-rigged the nut to the mount. I realize I've compromised the integrity of the mount and the nut will never be as securely fasted as the original, factory manufacturing but it does the job and I feel bad asking for a replacement since I am pretty much responsible for the nut coming off in the first place. It would behoove GoPro to consider improving the formula for fastening the nut onto the mount so there is a stronger bond between the nut and the mount. Perhaps there is a cheaper, stronger adhesive GoPro can consider researching if it is cost effective. Anyways, overall very happy with the product and am simply providing constructive criticism to GoPro and a fair warning to other skier who use the mount while skiing. Make sure to take the mount off after use!

I use 305 mainly for my running but also started using it with Garmin forerunner Bike Mount and it works well on the bike.

Pros
 1. Much improved reception of GPS signals
 2. Improved hardware integrity or sturdiness
 3. Ease of transferring data to the computer and a
  great software of mapping and analyzing the run data.
Cons
 1. Not comfortable to wear this for a long run.
  There is a sharp edge at the bottom corner which
  rubs against my wrist and it gets pretty painful
  after about 10 miles of run. I have to put a
  bandage to reduce the problem.
 2. Distance reading is consistently shorter by about
  1% both with 101 and 305. It was annoying at the
  beginning but I don't think it is a big problem now.

2043711,"This product performs much better than the stock solution that came with my ATI HD 4850, however there are some compatibility issues with this particular combination:

The included voltage regulator module (VRM) heatsinks are **incompatible** with the ATI HD 4850 so I recommend you to get the Arctic Cooling Turbo Module (search keywords: Arctic Cooling VGATurbo) or attach a 120mm fan with zip ties to avoid overheating. Moreover, there's no enough clearance between one of the heatpipes and one of the RAM heatsinks, you either have to bend one heatsink fin, or leave the RAM module partially or totally exposed.

Installation proved to be difficult because of the above mentioned modification and also because the RAM heatsinks do not stick well to the modules. Also, the plastic clamp mechanism requires precise alignment which even when installed correctly, kept popping out of place risking the integrity of the (optional) Turbo Module fans.

Despite all these issues, I'm satisfied with its performance, paired with the Turbo Module my card has reached idle temperatures of 36C (same system temperature with case door open).

Pros:
* Drastically reduces card temperatures
* Silent even with the optional ""Turbo Module""
* Visually looks great

Cons:
* Difficult installation with ATI HD 4850
* Huge! (might not fit in certain computer cases)
* No VRM heatsinks for ATI HD 4800 series (hopefully will be fixed in future revisions)
* RAM heatsinks adhesive is weak
* Crossfire connection might require modification since the heat spreaders are in the way",4.0
10326797,"Great - a well reviewed, region free blu ray and DVD player to watch a lot of great foreign movies and TV series.

Well, that was the functionality advertized...

What we received was a BD-H5100 (retail $62.99) with a sticker on the back with the words ""Region Free"" on it. Did it play UK DVDs? yes. Did it play UK Blu Rays? No - just a message saying ""This Blu Ray can only be played on Region B players.""

So, we asked Samsung - they said that they don't make region free players for sale in the US. When we peeled back the ""Region Free"" label, which was pretty shoddy when peeled back - very ""home-made"", there was the official Samsung ""Region A"" Blu Ray code.

Disclaimer: reviews are just personal opinions, and not accusations, but here's our opinion for what it's worth: we did some research on the internet, and players can be ""hacked"" to make them region free, so perhaps what we received was a $62.99 unit that had been hacked (unsuccessfully) by someone, then they placed a ""Region-Free"" sticker on it, then sold it through Amazon with a $90 mark up (we paid $153). We have no idea whether this is the case, it's just our opinion, but if it's correct, then perhaps Amazon is being duped as well as we bought this direct from Amazon, and not through a third party.

From my wired units that all suffered a painfull lightning strike death, to my first wireless router simply giving up the ghost for no apparent reason.  Of those 4 routers prior to this rangebooster model, I never once had any issues.  Tech support was always spot on if they were needed.

Now for the sad news.  After my first Linksys wireless router died I assumed this WRT54GR rangebooster model would be better than my older WRT54G style.  I was wrong.  I use my router for two purposes.  One, to share cable internet access among 6 PCs in the house, and two, to limit access to the internet through the access limitations function built into the router.  This is where I found fault with this version of Linksys router.  The rangebooster router outpaced my old unit it all internet speed tests but could not function properly if I enabled an access restriction.  If I enabled any access restrictions it not only kept the kids off the net after 9PM as it should, but it also kept a number of other internet programs and functions from working.  Enable an access restriction and no longer could we upload pics to any photo sites, we could not use Google Earth, nor could I hold a Linksys tech support live chat.  After working with Linksys' tech support team for 6 weeks or better, installing beta firmware and even getting a replacement router, the issues were still there in both rotuers.  Long story short, if you want a fast router and don't need any of the special features built in such as access restrictions, this router will work wonders.  However I would not pay a premium for this router under any circumstance.  The basic WRT54G that cost ~ $40 - $50 is a better choice at this time.  If Linksys does step up and fix the issues through a new firmware release this router may be acceptable.  But for now there are a number of better routers available at a lesser cost.",3.0

I'm a huge fan of Thermaltake since I use their power supplies in my computers.  They're the only brand I use because throughout the years of building PCs, they last the longest.  Anyway, being backed by Thermaltake, I knew this would be a quality product.

After opening it I was very impressed with the build.  There are no sharp edges anywhere and it's very clean and symmetrical.  The weighted base with rubberized coating sticks to my wooded surface and doesn't slide around.  I enjoy the stand so much that I bought another one in black for my HE400i.",5.0

8820389,"I purchased the HP Phoenix 800-060 to replace an HP Pavilion desktop with a quad core Q6600 processor.  The HP Phoenix 800-060 model with 16GB DR3 SDRAM, 1TB 7200rpm harddrive, Nvidia GeForce GTX645 w/2GB GDDR5 , Windows 8 OS, and best of all a 4th gen Intel i7-4770 processor.  Upon inspecting the insides (motherboard and configuration) I noticed a CPU cooler that is included which is great but not mentioned.  Sure you can build your own system but the total price (and time) to build a similar system would surely take over $1K and Amazon had the HP Phoenix 800-060 model for a lot less.

My only complaint which is minor is they could have included a larger hard drive (2TB instead of 1TB) especially when hard drives are so cheap.  I did pickup a Toshiba 2TB HDD for $90.  The package arrived several days later in excellent condition and I was able to get up and running (disconnect and reconnecting all the cables from my old PC) in less than 10 minutes.

It did take a little bit of time to get use to using Windows 8 especially from Windows Vista Home Edition. There was a free upgrade for Windows 8.1 from Microsoft so everything is up to date.

10433323,"This is a great case for any phantom. I transported my phantom in it over 800 miles and it worked perfectly.

Pros:
It is very well built and the cutouts for everything are great. I love how its deep enough that the props can say on the phantom and are also securely fully surrounded by foam, so there is no chance of them getting damaged from the lid pushing down on them. Just make sure they are in the cutout completely and your set. The material the case is made out of is very hardy and held up to everything I could throw at it. The wheels and all handles, including the extendable one, is very strong and don't feel flimsy or like you need to be cautious with them. The closing clips are very strong and hold closed with no second thought.

Cons:
Im pretty sure its too big for any carry on. But thats not what I was looking for. Theres a phone cutout but it was for a smaller phone, but that could be altered fairly easily. The only other thing was the camera seemed like it was touching the bottom foam when the phantom was in its cutout. I don't think it was anything to even consider but I thought I would just mention it since I encountered it. I just added some of the shipping paper (very small amount) into the bottom cutout for the landing gear to sit on and that fixed it. Some think its not as well made as a pelican case, but is not too different in my opinion.

GREAT over all case. And you don't have to worry about plucking your own foam since everything is precut perfectly.",5.0
17913804,"I just purchased vudu set top box (which you can only buy second hand now) and find it to be an excellent alternative to the local video store (sorry). Vudu has the newest releases (same day, typically Tuesday's) in SD, HD & HDX for 3.99, 4.99 & 5.99. While netflix costs less by far, you cannot ""stream"" new releases for months and some titles not at all in my experience. I am a netflix user so I am not slamming them. I can watch Tuesday releases in HD at 4.99 and not have to go to the store and then go back to return the dvd. Seems green to me. To my great pleasure vudu just added a bunch of very good ""apps"" including New York Times, TEDtalks, Pandora, facebook, twitter, Wikipedia, good NEWS, good Movie/TV stuff and Picassa for your photos. While the new bluray players have apps and vudu as well I found that the Samsung apps (with vudu) were not what I wanted and the Sony (which I bought and does not have vudu) is pretty much directed by Sony (of course and why not). Having the external vudu box gives me the best of those two worlds and I highly recommend the box at least until netflix can deliver ""release day"" streaming in HD. I have spoken with netflix about that very subject and while they ""are working on it"" you can imagine the complications of streaming new releases for as little as $10 a month.

5867745,"At first I thought this computer was perfect for me. The color, metal like exterior, and keyboard, were all my type: stylish, yet durable. However, upon two days of use the underlying flaws in this computer were apparent. The computer itself was slow, froze often (especially when doing simple things like scrolling), and when playing music--whether on youtube, windows media, or pandora-- the computer would freeze and emit a loud jackhammer-skipping noise. This was bothersome becsause the  speakers weren't loud in the first place. Also, when playing videos on full screen mode everything was pixelated. Not horribly so that I couldn't watch, but it was definitely noticeable and irksome.
The battery life also didn't last long, about 3.45 hours tops without playing music.
In terms of cosmetic problems the only thing I didn't care for in terms of the metal exterior/keyboard was that sweat and grease stains showed up  on the trackpad and exterior.

2333035,"As a pro and creative photographer I step away from pro lenses which give great results, but for creativity they can be limited. I got this lens to add to a Canon T2i I use for casual and creative work. The lenses is worth the price. Good quality construction, auto-focus work well. I suggest getting a UV filter for the front to add as a protection barrier for the lens, I keep a filter on ALL my lenses for this purpose. This lens does have hard plastic mount and plastic threads up front. The plastic filter threads can be a problem if you don't take the time to carefully put the filters on, but if you use a UV filter all the time on it you won't have a problem anyway. The plastic mount in the back works and fits just fine. I have seen some reviews of people complaining about the mount being plastic. If you think you have to have a metal mount then you are abusing your equipment. I have had lenses and cameras get trashed doing wildlife photography(usually do to animal interaction), a metal mount would not have saved the equipment. This lens isn't going to give you pro level optics, but it isn't suppose to since it isn't a pro lens. If you need pro level optics then buy pro lenses.

18568691,"I have had my 5010 for about 2 weeks now.  My previous tablet was a Toshiba, before that was an Acer.  Both of these had to be retired because of failures with the cases.  I am thus very impressed with the solidity of the 5010.  It is light but feels sturdy.  The hinge is firm, with no sway or wobble.  The screen is crisp and bright, and remains so even with the backlight turned down to half.  I had worried that a 13.3"" screen would be too small for me.  However, this accomodates an 7.5 x 10 size note-taking space easily.

The 5010 is definitely fast enough for Office applications, and low-end gaming--I haven't tried any high end.  Other reviewers have commented on heat and noise.  The 5010 is quieter and cooler than the Toshiba, and heat does not limit my use of the machine.  The high capacity battery provides about 3.5 hours of note-taking.  With the swappable CD bay battery that goes up to 5.5.

Cons/Regrets
--I didn't check out the T1010 before I bought it
--I bought it before Windows7 came out (Vista stinks)
--There are only USB ports on two sides of the machine--I'd prefer two or three ports on three sides, for flexibility when in slate mode.
--The touchscreen is so rigid that I get a lot of clicking noise when I put pen to screen.  This is also a plus, I suppose.
--Fujitsu phone customer service has been so-so (related to getting Windows7).  The online chat has been great (realted to turning off the 'scroll sensor').

There is no software for the mac that allows access to settings for the camera so you can't sync the cam, can't set the date function and if the software allows for other cam settings like audio settings you won't be able to access them using a mac.

I charged up the cam up and hit the road. After my 45 minute drive I removed the sd card and loaded it using a card reader onto my mac. Well what I had was a folder with 27 individual movie files all 3 minutes long.  If I wanted to see my video contiguously it required splicing all the segments together, not a project I wanted to mess with. The files equated to 6 gig of video so to edit it into a single film would require at least 12 gig of available space. Another major flaw was the audio. While I was driving I had the car stereo playing at a reasonable level (not window rattling). When I played back the segments not one had audio on it that could be heard even when I played it back at full volume on my mac.

The video was so jittery that it was beyond annoying to watch. I absolutely expected this camera to have image stabilization.  So that along with no audio, no ability to date the recording and no access to the cameras settings I had no choice except to return the cam.

Pros:
It connects bluetooth to the phone very easily. It charges my phone through the USB port.  It is very sturdy in the cigarette lighter receptacle.  It kinda looks cool.

Cons:
Its definitely larger and longer than I had expected.  My lighter plug is on my dash, above my manual shifter, near my steering wheel.  Since its kinda big and doesnt flex that easily, its always in the way.  If your lighter plugs in directly to the vertical face of your dash, be warned: it takes the entire length of flex arm to bend the controller 90 degrees.  This will take up a lot of space.  The play/forward/reverse buttons don't work with my ATT Samsung Captivate.  I live in a big city so I'm always picking up static.  It cant seem to scan to a clear station.  It also cuts in and out completely from time to time.  I'm not sure if this is the bluetooth, FM, or a general error.  The sound isn't the best either.  It doesnt seem to put out a full range of sound.  It's seems worse than radio and actually kinda reminds me of a cassette tape.

Conclusion:
This stuff isn't new technology.  Its an expensive adapter for such a simple idea.  I would have expected $50+ when bluetooth first came out, but not in 2011.  For $50 it should have been smaller, more maneuverable, and have a fuller range of sound.  I give it a 3 out of 5.",3.0

I understand that the chances of leaking on today's solutions is greatly reduced, but to put it simply: the worst that can happen on this is a broken fan. Easy fix.

Installation was considerably easier and less head-ache inducing that the 212-EVO, but I still managed to nick part of a knuckle's skin during installation. This is likely more my fault than any issue with this cooler though, and I feel this was one of the easier installations I've done.

The fans...well, if you haven't heard enough about them yet, believe the hype. Noctua fans are by far my favorites. I replaced all the case fans on my new computer, and it is an absolutely dead-silent build. No water pump noises as well either.

In short, if you want a silent, effective solution, and aren't keen on either the risks (however minimal) or extra noise of a water cooling solution, this is your ticket.

3361884,"I have tried other tuners in the past, and have been disappointed. Both with their tuning devices, speed, and software included.
However, technology around those time when I had those tuners to now has drastically changed. So I cannot comment on their current progress today.

Now with Windows Media Center, the compatible hardware is the only thing I am requiring, and AverMedia has impressed me in the last two years.
I've gotten an ExpressCard Tuner for my Laptop, a USB Tuner for a Mac, and two of these for an HTPC.

They all work well and tune fast with Windows Media Center. Note: This tuner requires you to use Windows 7 Windows Media Center. This is a limitation of the white box one, which is quite fine for me, and probably many users due to the much better software that WMC is compared to the usual bundled software often shipped with retail TV Tuner cards.  Also, to use this card with Windows XP Media Center or Windows Vista Media Center, you need an analog tuner before it works (limitation of the XP and Vista software I guess...) with the digital tuning ONLY capabilities of this card.  (also to note, XP and Vista only allow up to 2 digital signals / 1 duet card on their Media Centers...Win 7 allows a max of 4 / 2duet cards)

For me, with Windows 7, it detected my two Duets as 4 tuner cards, and runs like a charm! Since I don't have cable/sat I'm enjoying free Over the Air HDTV, and able to record 4 Channels at once, no need to pay $50+ a month for a ""subsidized"" DVR for us OTA HDTV folks.  Plus the Duets have cut my Coaxial Cables down to Two instead of 4!

The internet and chrome seem to also work well for a tablet of this price. Now for the bad. I found that alot of the apps i like are not compatible with this model/tablet for some reason?

What a nightmare! So I called the local TV store where I bought the TV and they promptly sent over a repairman. The repairman ran some tests, then ordered a part from Sony which took 3 weeks to get here. When he came by to install the part it didn't work. He loaded it onto his van and took it too the store. He called me later and told me it was a different part that was bad (Tekon Board?) and that Sony won't even ship that part separately, its only sold with the TV as a whole. So basically my TV is dead. In the meantime my warranty just passed 12 months. The repairman was great, he called Sony and tried to get me a replacement TV. He told me they want to talk to me before they can send out the TV. So I called them (which is a nightmare, worst customer service in history). After finally getting a human being on the phone and explained my story, she explains I need to talk to tech support. I told her my TV is dead and tech support can't help me, I need a replacement. She put me through to Tech support after I waited on hold for 40 minutes. The tech support guy was frankly an ass. He told me that it wasn't Sony's fault that it was past the warranty and I should have called earlier. I explained to him that I was waiting for the part to arrive from Sony so I thought things were being taken care of! He practically hung up on me by the end of the conversation.

Very well designed; controls are easy to operate, even in the dark. Reception is very clear, no static, no drift. We pick up a public radio FM station 60 miles away without any problem.  Simply the best reception, sound, and ease of operation of any radio we have ever had. Zero frustration factor, which is always a plus.  Bought our first one of these over a year ago and have never had any trouble with it.  Love the slim, compact footprint. Fits practically anywhere. We cannot overstate how pleased we are with these radios.  And NO we did not get them free or discounted in exchange for a glowing ""unbiased"" review. This radio merits the 5-star rating quite on its own.
UPDATE: It has been several years since we purchased our first Sangean radio. We now have one of these units in every room, the back porch and even the garage.  We have had no trouble with any of them. Reception is excellent and sound quality is remarkable.

In the fully charged state, the negative plate consists of Lead (Pb), and the positive plate Lead dioxide (PbO2), with the electrolyte of concentrated Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4). Negative plate reaction: Pb(s) + HSO4'(aq) ' PbSO4(s) + H+(aq) + 2e'. Positive plate reaction: PbO2(s) + HSO4'(aq) + 3H+(aq) + 2e' ' PbSO4(s) + 2H2O(L). The total reaction can be written as Pb(s) + PbO2(s) + 2H2SO4(aq) ' 2PbSO4(s) + 2H2O(L). In the discharged state both the positive and negative plates become Lead(II) Sulfate (PbSO4), and the electrolyte loses much of its dissolved Sulfuric Acid and becomes primarily water - the same reactions go backwards (arrows backwards).

1172534,"I bought this product to charge and listen to my ipod. I barely had it for a year, when the front display cover melted off. (problem with overheating? I'm not blocking any ventilation.) No problem: I will just super glue it back on. Other issues are that the FM stations don't come in that well. Apparently Emerson has never heard of an antenna. They just tell you that it is integrated into the power cord, which is probably one of the laziest ideas I've ever heard! Overall, this product is all right, I even use the Aux function once in a while when I want more bass from my computer. The remote is a great idea, and I use it frequently with the product.

Two years from buying the iTone, the display got really dim. Now changing from bright to dim makes the display turn off. And I can barely see the time already. Please keep in mind that if you do plan on buying this, the display will probably fizzle out after 2 years of use.

Also, planning on selling this crappy product, I decided to list it on eBay. I tested it a few days later to find that the device would no longer turn on. It basically went from ""okay"" to ""dead"" in less than 2 1/2 years.

I have them connected to a router in the basement, a PS4 and security camera on the main floor, and a PC on the second floor.  The adapter connected to the PC on the second floor is as far away from the adapter plugged into the router as you can physically get in my house and the the speed of all the adapters exceeds the bandwidth of my ISP (100 Mbps downstream).  I have not tested the PC to PC throughput yet but 100 Mbps is adequate for my needs.  Setup was extremely easy and I have not had to reboot any of them even once.  They do get a little warm but that's not exactly surprising.  They will automatically go into a sleep mode if the device they are plugged into is turned off or disconnected but that is unlikely since most devices will maintain power to the Ethernet port even if they're turned off.

22235,"Having lived through three hurricanes in two years, I wanted to be prepared.  I had heard great things about the Superradio, and I'm thrilled to say that it does what it claims to do.

In the pre-Internet era, I loved tuning my transistor radio to far-away stations.  From Waterbury, Connecticut in the 1970s I listened to Chicago (WBBM, WGN), St. Louis (KMOX), Cinciunatti (WLW), Cleveland (WWWE), Wheeling (WWVA), Charlotte (WBT), and Canada.  My favories were WKBW in Buffalo for the Amazin' Jim Quinn, WTOP in Washington, D.C. for news.  I became a huge Orioles fan as I listened to Earl Weaver get himself tossed from many games on WBAL.  Bob Prince was smooth on WDKA's Pirates games.  Sure, you can listen to station from around the world on the Internet, but for some reason there's a special thrill of DXing far away stations...even if almost every one is running George Noory.

I have been amazed at how bad AM radio sounds on my expensive home and car receivers.  The Superradio made AM sound like it once did.  The poor quality AM isn't the fault of the stations, it is the receivers.  Admit it, it never occurred to you to consider how AM sounded when you purchased you list receiver.

The sound quality in the following review is without burning; I don't know if there'll be a difference after burning. Anyway, these headphones deliver an excellent sense of space and focus.

6034420,"I recently picked up the SupCase Slim Fit Leather case for the Nexus 7, and this is my review.

Build Quality: The case is pretty well made. It's not the most well constructed leather case, but it's made well enough. The stitching is alright with a few quirks here and there. It's also not genuine leather if you couldn't already tell. It's like a rubbery and synthetic like material wrapped in a leather wrapping. Despite not being genuine, the leather does look and feel nice.

Cutouts: No issues here really. SupCase did a really nice job with this case, it offers near perfect cutouts for all ports and buttons. I had no issues accessing anything.

Design: The Slim Fit Leather Case is a folio-style case, or book-like if you will. You need to slip your Nexus 7 inside and tuck a flap underneath. The flap is held nicely with velcro so it's very secure. The fit and alignment of the Nexus is also good inside the case. I did notice at times that because there is a frame that surrounds the tablets bezel, it would sometimes hinder accessing things at the top, bottom, and sides of the screen. You just need to sort of work around it, but it is definitely something to keep note of. The case also incorporates a stand. You prop it up by taking the front flap and tucking it underneath the holder on the back of the case. This gives you two stand options: a keyboard typing angle, and an upright viewing angle for videos and other media consumption.

Sleep/Wake: The case has embedded magnets that turn the Nexus 7 on/off. Not ON/OFF literally, but it awakes it and puts it to sleep. The magnet also keeps the front flap closed as well to prevent it from flopping around. The magnets are just strong enough to perform the sleep/wake and keep shut. I have also not noticed the front flap turning the Nexus to sleep when folded all the way back.

Overall, I can highly recommend the SupCase Slim Fit Leather case for the Nexus 7. It offers nice style, protection, precise cutouts, and decent functionality. Moreover, it's only $15!",5.0

I bought it thinking it would at least serve as a burglar deterrent even if it fell short on delivering on its advertised features.  What a pleasant discovery to find that it does everything as described, and extremely well.

My doorbell is mounted on a wall perpendicular to my front door.  I mounted SkyBell HD on the optional wedge.  The device rapidly detects when someone approaches my front door.  The field of view includes the entire torso of a person at my door, along with most of my front walk.  When a visitor comes through my front door into my home, the video even shows the interior entryway of my home.

The device reliably alerts me on my mobile phone whenever someone approaches my front door, provides great quality video, rings my doorbell even if the visitor does not actually do so, and offers very good quality audio both outside via SkyBell HD and on my mobile phone.

What initially helped sway me to buy it was the fact that there's no ongoing charge for video monitoring and storage.  All together, I am extremely impressed with the superb value received.",5.0

It is stable and performs admirably with whatever I try to do. It even works well with memory hogs such as Adobe software packages (ie. Premiere Pro, CS2).

The only real issues I had with it were when I had the original factory install (Win XP Home, Norton Antivirus etc). Once I upgraded to XP Pro and loaded my own software, it worked great. It got better once I upgraded its memory to over a gig.

Pros:
Overall pretty fast
Stable
Bright display
Nice sound from its speakers
Dual Layer DVD+RW drive
Withstands my abuse (I'm not always gentle with it)
HP Support (hours after emailing HP about an issue, I recieved a solution. She kept emailing me until I replied back to give feedback. In that particular case, the solution worked.)

Cons:
Power hog...battery lasts only 2 hours because its processor wasn't designed for a notebook
Fan is loud (because it gets too hot)
Gets extraordinarily hot
Slow spinning HD (4200 RPM)... I use external HDs when I need faster performance
Only expandable to 2 gig RAM (due to change in industry standard)

Overall, this computer is great. I won't get a new PC because of its cons. And despite its size and weight, I still travel with it.

If or when I do get a new computer, it will be a Mac.

I paired mine with a third-party leather band and now I have a very nice looking watch to wear at work so I don't have to take out my phone so much and look like the Millennial that I am.

Notifications are disabled promptly on the phone and you can personalize which apps will cause notifications to pass to the watch, as well as how many and what time of vibration. You have four slots when customizing a vibration pattern and each one can be filled with ""Short"", ""Long"", or no buzz. For example, for texts, I do one short, a pause and two shorts. For work emails (Outlook) I use two long, and for personal emails (Gmail), I use one short, and one long.

The watch seems relatively sturdy but I have taken care to keep it far away from water.

The charger is an extra long micro-USB (think the same as most Android phones, but twice as long) which is annoying. When I travel, it's one more charger cable to carry.

3159851,"Bought this 1.5TB drive in local Fry's in Bay Area over the weekend since it was cheaper there. Drive is neatly packaged with cellophane film on the top to avoid finger-print/scratches/dust on the shiny/glossy surface. There is a small green LED activity light in the front but its very tiny and doesn't annoy a bit like some of the big bright LEDs on other external hard drives.

This is 7200 RPM drive and comes with its own power-supply adapter which must be used to power-up this drive. It is not a portable drive and is not USB-bus powered.

This drive doesn't come pre-loaded with any backup/encryption software. However it does come up with a small .exe file which when run takes you to Seagate's product registration page where it automatically fills the Drive Serial Number, so you just enter your name/email and register the product. I like registering as it helps locating the details of the drive in case you have to call customer service for repair/replace under manufacturer's warranty (which is 2 years for this drive). You can altogether not run it at all if you don't want to register.

Everytime I plug in this drive, it makes a large clicking sound once but after that it goes quiet while running. I plugged it into a Macbook Pro and created 2 partitions, one for MAC (HFS) and other for Windows (NTFS). I then used Time-Machine software that came with my Macbook to take a backup on MAC partition. It was quite smooth with no issues. I then unplugged the drive and connected to a Windows 7 laptop and it recognized the 2 partitions immediately, HFS being Read-Only and NTFS being Read-write. I then took my Windows 7 backup using in-built Windows backup software and it also went quite smooth.

So far no issues with the drive. It does tend to attract fingerpints/dust on its shiny surface since I removed the cellophane from it.",5.0

Other speakers are little bit big (~9"") compared to what's available in market but its not bulky. For many days, I considered these spkrs along with Polk1600, RM705, 6750, HarmonKrdn, Energy etc but all of those were more expensive and 5.1 spkrs. Certainly those speakers look stylish and smaller but subwoofer is in 50-100W range. Onkyo-870 comes with thundering 230w subwoofer.. more than enough to feel booms... thuds... and blasts... Fry's had these speakers on display as part of Onkyo7300 HTIB, so I checked actual size before buying it. Currently I'm using only 5.1 and plan to use 2 additional speakers for Zone 2.

* boxy older design
* does not support use of banana plugs

In all the reviews I have read there is one flaw that seems to appear frequently, .....faulty USB connector.
I received my camera, I immediately read the manuals, installed the software, and started shooting (I love the artificial shutter sound). I went to transfer the pictures to my PC (Windoze XP on a P4)... and guess what... It couldn't find the camera.
I reread the software and camera manuals 2 times. There are no soft or hard switches to enable the USB port. I set the camera to all possible modes (including transfer) no luck. I tried another USB port, another USB cable, I upgraded the DImage Software, I upgraded the camera's firmware, I tried the cable with my 3030 it worked on all USB ports, I read the flash card through a card reader ...the DImage software found the card and transferred the pictures.
The USP Port is broken, faulty, flawed, kaput.
Back it goes..
Repackaged..
Dropped at UPS for return to the merchant... (Tough choice, back to the merchant or to Minolta for repair! I opted to return it to the merchant to avoid the inevitable frustration of proving to the manufacturer that the camera is actually broken, and I'm not retarded... i.e. ""Try this"" ""Try that"" we'll send you new software yada yada yada)
Wait 15 days while the wheels of the dot com bureaucracy crank out a replacement camera. (the only bad thing about buying online is returns)
If you buy this camera TEST THE USB PORT IMMEDIATELY! I've read of too many USB failures from too many consumer reviews for this to be a coincidence. I think Minolta isn't adquately testing the camera's USB port during it's QA process.

After 6 months of use we started hearing pops so we called Polk and they and us get the soundbar to them.  They replaced the amp in it at no cost and it solved the problem.  Short of that the experience has been excellent.  Polk support was stellar.

I stand behind this product and recommend that you give it an opportunity because it is a high quality sound and support.

5144434,"I am writing my review on the Logitech Tablet Keyboard at this very moment.  I am really impressed at how well the keyboard works - it took me less than 30 seconds to set up after my iPad discovered the keyboard via bluetooth.  All I had to do was enter a 4 digit number, push enter, and off I went, typing up notes, writing emails, and entering website addresses with so much more ease than using the iPad's touchscreen keyboard.  The keyboard itself is shaped very similarly to Apple's keyboards, although the keys are a little more rounded on the corners and don't have as good of a ""spring"" as the Apple.  Like most Apple keyboards, the keyboard is smaller than that of a PC's, so users with larger hands may have a more difficulty using it.

One thing I really like about this particular keyboard set is the carrying case.  The carrying case is included and is made of hard plastic.  It completely covers the keys on the keyboard, and packs really small.  The best thing is that it can open up slightly and be used as a prop for the iPad - the design works so hand in hand with the iPad that even with a protective cover on, I can prop up the iPad on this case.  I really can't imagine going back to using my iPad's touchscreen to type up long emails while traveling or on the go - this keyboard is awesome!

I've always loved polk's sound quality, and I bought these as soon as they came out, even before they were on Amazon.com (I'm back to buy a second pair). I love these headphones, they sound great, fit comfortably, and do not have as much cord noise as other headphones. These are great for jogging, or being at the gym, and I use these just at work too. It takes a few tries to get the flexible ear hook just right, but they fit nicely after be correctly adjusted. Now I'm just crossing my fingers hoping that polk comes out with some headphones without the ear strap, for more laid back music listening; although the ear strap is good for sports/active activities.

  -great sound quality
  -fit snugly and comfortably
  -adjustible cord length

11196577,"Absolutely love the look of this piece! It's exactly the style I wanted and a good sound for the price point in my opinion. It plays records very nicely and has more than sufficient sound amplification. I was surprised to find that even though a decent amount of sound comes out of the base of the unit, you definitely get the illusion that it's mostly coming out of the horn. The horn connects in the back to the same stereo system, so sound actually does come through it. I was just surprised how much the horn takes center stage over the unit speakers. Definitely what I was wanting! I did subtract one star in my review for a few technical issues with the unit that I detail below.

A few points that I think will help anyone else making the decision to buy this:

1. Bluetooth isn't great.

The bluetooth on this unit does not have a great buffer capacity, so streaming music from from my phone would skip and stutter. The line in jack works perfectly well though, so you can still get sound-in to work through this input.

2. Poor documentation.

The documentation for assembling this unit is non-existent. You have to assemble the horn with two types of screws and it doesn't give you any diagram for how to do this. After some trial and error, I figured out that the sharp ended screws connect (1) the pipe segments together, (2) the horn to the pipe, and (3) the middle of the support brace to the back of the pipe. The flat ended screws connect (1) the pipe to the stereo base and (2) the supporting brace to the stereo base.

3. Misfitting piece.

The distance between the screw holes on the supporting brace (supporting brace connects to the back of the pipe) was way too wide to fit the holes drilled in the stereo base. I had to carefully bend the brace to bring these screw holes closer together to match the width drilled into the stereo base..",4.0

18876606,"Sound card arrived today, beautifully packaged, directly from S. Korea. Plugged into my Windows 10 (64-bit) computer, the system automatically installed a basic driver. This driver works well at a fixed sample rate of 48k.

I'd already downloaded the latest full driver from the manufacturer's website, and this turned out to be identical to the one contained on the included driver CD. Unfortunately, this driver installation package does not function on Windows 10, even with various compatibility mode settings. So for Windows 10, it appears the card is a fixed 48kHz sample rate device. (However, see Update, below, for workaround.)

I maintain a Windows 7 64-bit computer just for situations like this. On Windows 7, the included driver installation package works fine. The full driver package also installs the Audiotrak control panel which enables all of the supported sample rates. The SPDIF optical output, which is my primary usage, appears to support 44.1k, 48k, 88k, 96k, and even higher (except that the optical output stops at 96k).

The sound, as converted from the SPDIF optical out through my DAC, seems on a par with any other of my digital sources. It's a fine, beautifully made sound card useful for relieving the dependency on USB for PC digital audio playback.

*** Update 29-Dec-2016 - Workaround for full function on Windows 10 ***
I devised this workaround in two stages of discovery. First, I decided to bypass the failing InstallShield-based driver installation process by manually updating the driver file from the Device Manager. I just pointed to the installation directory containing the unpacked 64-bit driver file (Envy24HF.sys). That was successful, so at that point I had the inspiration to just copy over the EnvyADeck directory (which contains the executable of the audio control panel utility to set PCM modes and sample rates) from the working Windows 7 installation to my Windows 10 machine. This seemed worth a try since the accompanying DLL's were all in the same directory. Amazingly, this worked, yielding the full functionality of the Prodigy HD2 soundcard on Windows 10.",5.0

The problem with software-based encryption has always been that it's inconvenient and therefore rarely used when it ought to be (which is anytime your home might be burglarized, or anytime your laptop might be lost or stolen). On top of that, most applications use hidden cache files that remain unencrypted despite one's diligence. As far as I know, this is the first truly convenient and affordable encryption solution for the masses. Essentially, it's just like any external plug-and-play hard drive, only the data is automatically encrypted using 128-bit AES via hardware, including the boot sector, with no apparent loss in speed. The tiny hardware key is only needed when the drive powers up, and can then be removed. The drive can be dismounted and remounted without the key. The drive can be powered via USB using a special included cable that taps two USB ports (one for I/O and one for power). The build quality is good--although Wiebetech cut corners by using plastic for the front and back plates. This plastic is less apparent on the Mini but noticeable on the desktop versions, such that those used to solid aluminum chassis will feel disappointed that Wiebetech didn't go that extra mile and just make these drives perfect from start to finish. But perhaps a barrage of emails to [...] will convince them to use full metal chassis and just charge a bit more. On the desktop (3.5"" drive) models, the stand for holding the drive upright is also made of plastic, and a drive that worked without issue in an OWC Mercury Elite Pro vibrated in the ToughTech when in the upright position. Again--Wiebetech should use a bit more metal, particularly as these enclosures are fanless and need all the heatsinking they can get. Finally, you can purchase blank keys ($32 for 3) and a key programmer ($279) in case you want to make more duplicates or come up with your own 128-bits (useful if a key is lost or stolen and you feel that the security aspect of the drive has therefore been compromised). Kudos to Wiebetech for putting every aspect of the encryption process into our hands--albeit at a price.",4.0

6940417,"We purchased this for our two year old and we loved it!  Our two year old wasn't too much into technology so she was so so at first.  We gave her some time to get use to it and she got into it.  We love that several kiddos can use it - her cousin sometimes signs in as himself (the kiddos can set up different profiles).  It has a camera which works well to take pictures and movies (both front facing and rear facing).  The stylus is better than I thought, there is a game where she (now that she is three) can trace letters and learn the various ways to create the letters.  She loves to draw, so the little paint program is great to use with the stylus.  You can easily download movies (LeapFrog) but they're great, as well as various e-books.  I really like this tablet for my kiddo and the carrying case is awesome too since it keeps it and up to 6 game cartridges safe.

Many of the channels I could watch on the previous converter are rarely if ever available on this one. Some days, there are few channels that can be watched.

The build quality on the speaker is very nice with a soft rubberized texture.  The speaker has an AUX port for hooking up devices that do not have bluetooth.  2200 mah battery makes for long playback times (playback times vary by the volume level of course)  Bluetooth CSR 4.0 has a nice connection, we didn't notice any distortion or disconnects.  Calls used as a speaker phone worked well and both parties had no problems during the phone call.

3037523,"My experience with SSDs has been both good and bad. Sadly, the first SSD I bought was a CRUCIAL P64 that had (and still has) firmware issues that prevent it from operating correctly. After that debacle, I almost decided to skip getting a different SSD, but ultimately went for this one after doing some research. I am so glad I did. Installation is virtually effortless if you know anything about cloning drives, and I had it up and running in about 20 minutes time. My Windows 7 disk score went from 6.4 (CRUCIAL P64) to 7.2, and read/write speeds also shot through the roof. I have an average transfer rate of 172 MB/Sec when tested using HD-Tune 2.0, which allows me to book Windows 7 in about 35 seconds. Computer performance is now lightning quick, and all my applications load nearly instantly. Even poorly written programs like Outlook 2007 start immediately.

I was lucky enough to score one of these on sale through a competitor of Amazons (newegg) for about three-hundred bucks with a mail in rebate. At that price, the drive is an absolute steal. My only regret is that I didn't buy another one!

SSDs are most definitely the best upgrade on the market for most systems as the overall speed increase they offer is unbeatable. If you can afford this drive, you'd be hard pressed to find a better one in the same tier of drives (of course drives like the Patriot WARP are a bit faster, as are the OCZ Vertex Turbo, but you pay premium prices for marginal speed gains).

My only complaint as that the drive doesn't come with any cables or mounting rails f you plan to use it in a desktop. For the price, you'd think OCZ could throw in a few extras!

Here are the exact results from HD Tune if anyone is interested:

HD Tune: OCZ-VERTEX Benchmark

Transfer Rate Minimum : 128.9 MB/sec
Transfer Rate Maximum : 184.6 MB/sec
Transfer Rate Average : 171.2 MB/sec
Access Time  : 0.2 ms
Burst Rate  : 145.2 MB/sec
CPU Usage  : -1.0%

Overall this is a great SSD and much faster than my flawed P64 which has been relegated to my home computer as a boot drive.",5.0

11527179,"Up to now I have been tethered to wired devices only.  But I needed a wireless router to get the full use out of my smart TV and I wanted to be able to be on the internet with my smart phone without using data from my plan.  Because I will be the only user nearly all the time, this router has more than enough signal strength for what I'll need.

I could invite my nephews and their video game devices over and still have enough signal strength.

I am not the most technologically savvy person and have never set up a wireless router before, but the directions provided were really clear and easy to follow.  My desktop computer does not have wireless capability but the connection from this wireless router to the ethernet connection of my desktop were easy to figure out.  The setup of my network was much easier than I expected.

There are 4 ethernet connections plus a USB 3.0 connection and a USB/eSATA connection.  One feature I really like is that the power cord does not have a ""wall wart"" (aka the large box around the power plug). Instead the part that usually ends up in a wall wart is further up on the cord.  This is good because my power strip doesn't have room for too many large plugs and the cable box and speakers already have them.

1619690,"At the current price level (I paid around $32), these are a fantastic bargain. Now, they're not by any means high end audio, but if you want them to convert your bluetooth-enabled phone into a portable mini-stereo, this is the perfect product for that. As a bonus, the little bluetooth receiver clips to your collar so that you can use the included stereo headphones. You can navigate back/forward and pause/play from the receiver or from the phone, and it does even work as a speaker phone (though it's not the best speaker phone by any means).  I bought this mainly to have speakers to play music for my phone at the beach, and they are just perfect for that, just enough sound to enjoy without bugging anyone around you. The fact that I can also listen music around the house without being tethered to the device (phone or bluetooth-enabled computer) playing it is also very awesome.

The one thing to remember is if the speakers sound distorted, you have to turn them all the way down, then back up again. The speakers can be plugged in or run on 4 AAA batteries, and the same plug works for the speakers and to charge the receiver/medallion thingy. They can also be powered/charged by the included USB cable.

Highly recommended for extremely portable, lightweight, bluetooth stereo. They even include a nice rubbery carrying case to protect the speakers, though it would be nice if it had room for batteries and such.

Sonic told me their warranty grace period had expired but to send it in for techs to look at for repair. I shipped it and included the factory USB cable in the event it was bad? They sent me a new radio which was great, but no USB cable was included. I also left my personal SD card in it by mistake. (my bad) It too was missing!

As far as audio quality goes, I have felt no bother to go for anything more high-end than these....and I'm an audiophile; I have to game and watch movies on the latest Creative Zx sound card through my Onkyo THX 7.1 sound system. I have also owned the more expensive Bose Triport IE, and I can say that these sound MUCH better; the S4's don't leak sound, they don't let sound in, and they aren't too heavy on the bass. You also don't have to bump the volume all the way to ~90% (like the Triports), ~60% is sufficient to get your pump while working out. And, with version II, the Image S4's feel like a pair of headphones in the $150-$200 range (mainly do to the very good cabling).....A real bargain for less than $70.

So I called customer service (the number CLEARLY posted on Klipsch.com/contact) and explained my issues, and they told me to just email them a ""print-screen"" of my amazon invoice with my info. Calling and emailing Klipsch took no more than 10 minutes. 3 business later I received the UPGRADED Image S4's. From the day my original pair STARTED to give me problems, to the day I RECEIVED an upgraded pair, took only 3 bussiness days!

AMAZING! ........And my new pair also come with the same warranty! Cool!

Buying good-sounding headphones are one thing, but if you are going to use them heavily (such as for running or for working), you need to make sure that they will not give out (e.g. from 3.5mm plug failure). That will be money well wasted.....but NOT WITH KLIPSCH!",5.0

The velcro on the case needs to be placed differently to allow the flap to cover and close when there are somewhat bulky items in the Grid-It organizer section (the neoprene does not quite stretch enough to compensate..

In the beginning, it was a fine product, in the sense that it worked w/o any complications. You its just a tripod, right?  Well the more I used this product, 3-5 day a week, the more I started having problems; mainly with the extension of the segmented legs. The 1/2 turn unlock, 1/2 turn lock compression locks, began to fail. The releasing of the compression lock didn't always release as needed to extend the leg segments. When pulling the legs out, they will stick and then just pull completely out of the above leg segments. This has happened numerous tes and I am not capable to makes the repairs in the field. Also the white plastic internal compression shims crack and split. I have since in the past replaced this product. There is a design flaw that needs correcting. It may work for you w/o problems. I use larger and heavier cameras and lens setups most of the time.the main reason I purchased was its lightweight vs load capabilities. I've had this tripod less than one year and have had it repaired, three times. Good luck if you buy one as they seemed ok for an enthusis, not more advanced usage, as a semi, or full time professional. They are not, in

1085306,"I recently ordered this product after months of research as to the right PMP for me. Im a WindowsXP MC user, who prefers WMP to iTunes, and especially love the ability to 'drag and drop' files directly to my GigaBeat as I have an external HD I take from, and don't have time to library all 250gigs of MP3 files.

My initial impressions are extremely high. Ive found the interface to be seamless for anyone who uses a Windows OS, and the folder layouts and navigation to be perfect. It does take a little bit of getting used to (going side to side with a menu across the top etc), but I wouldnt trade it.

The video/picture quality is better than I expected after reviews. I have not had time to test a darker movie yet, but all signs point to not having to worry when I do. The picture is clear and bright -- and plenty clear enough to see in daytime or darkness.

The buttons on the side seem well placed to me, though I expect to be more comfortable after I memorize their placements.

Id prefer more background and color options than the standard windows background, and grey visual during mp3 play. But it doesn't affect the usage of the product at all.

I wouldnt have minded the scroll wheel found on ipods and recent ripoffs, but find the crosshair option found on the Gigabeat plenty sufficient. Its just not as 'fun'.

Ive had no issues with the battery life during music play.

The only downside to the player Ive found so far is the lack of made-for accessories. Cases are starting to be made in low supply, but otherwise your options are to look of Ipod capable items (cables etc), and hoping they fit.

Not until the next morning did we learn that the devasting tornadoes that hit Lady Lake, Florida, were less than ten miles from us. We don't have any sirens or other alarms that can warn us except those that appear on TV or radio. In watching the aftermath of the storms and hearing the concerns of others like me that weren't aware, I learned of the weather radios that can be programmed to sound an alarm when there are severe weather warnings. So I ordered the Midland WR-100B SAME Weather and All Hazards Alert Monitor With Alarm Clock. It is capable of airing the local weather bureau's continuous weather forecasts at the touch of a button and can monitor the local area to be ready to alert in the event of severe weather warnings being issued by the local weather service. Since I have had the radio (only a few weeks) we have had a couple of severe thunderstorm warnings and the radio sounded the alarm just as I expected it to.

1- This digital camera does much more than I need - I really like the small ""shirt-pocket"" size.  I tend to carry it more often so I am less-frequently without the camera when a good photo opportunity arises.

Minus:

1- The software takes over your PC and is not flexible to use.

2- The camera's video is a proprietary format (Quicktime) and Kodak does not provide software to save or convert the videos to a more standard format that can be burned to a CD or DVD and viewed on a DVD player.  I had to spend over $50 on 3rd party software that is difficult to use and it is a pain to have to do the extra conversion step with each video.

3- Kodak does not support the most popular printers in my office (HP color 2500).  It seems they want you to buy their printers even if you already have a printer that is superior.

Because of these closed-system, incompatibility issues, I rated the camera package and Kodak LOW.

- If you are advanced and can support yourself with other software, it is a great camera.

- If you are a beginner and want to just buy all Kodak compatible stuff and have Kodak software always running on your PC, it is also great.

- I really dislike that, to allow use of this software, Kodak forces a user to have the software launch on their PC.  Don't they understand that we users are trying to use this sometimes at work and would like a more discreet software package that will not pop up randomly (yes it does) on our screens, stay resident in the icon tray, etc?

When Bought:  Great picture quality, has many different settings from basic to fine and also different options of resolutions from 640 to 2400. The manual mode is good, it allows you to control white balance, allows for manual zoom, and changing the ISO up to 800.  I mostly take pictures in this mode since the color is more true once you have adjusted these settings.  I think all settings stay saved for the exception of the manual focus which you would have to reactivate everytime you turn the camera on.  The video mode is great in full light yet it gives very low quality vidios if the indoor lighting is not bright.

At the Present:

I believe there are better cameras out there, yet this camera at its present price might still be attractive. The issue of focus error starting happening to me only after the camera slipped off of my hands once and landed on the ground. Eversince them I get this message everyonce in a while.

I bought this shotgun mic because the built-in microphone on my Canon Rebel T4i / 650D was terrible. You lose a lot of audio fidelity with it. I wasn't expecting much from this microphone, but it pleasantly surprised me. The audio sounded very crisp and sharp, not overly bass-y like the T4i's mic. A great valued starter mic for videographers who also want to record audio.

There is some white noise - a very faint hissing sound. However, since this hissing is constant and at the same volume, it's very easy to remove in Audacity or any other audio editing software. Just google ""how to remove background noise audacity"" and you'll be fine.

I have two pairs of Sennheiser headphones: the G4ME ONEs and HD 280s. Of the two, I've had the 280s the longest (around 3 and a half years), and both sound great.

The HM5s don't fit perfectly to the HD 280s, but they're tight to the driver housing and are easy to install (it took less than 10 minutes total and there are guides just a quick Google search away on how to remove the stock earpads; installing is basically the reverse).

I have since gotten this drive to work with linux systems. I completely wiped and reformatted the drive as ext2 and it works fine with my linux distro (Puppy Linux).

The description only says PC and Mac, but I had hoped it would work with my Linux systems, too. Using Ubuntu 10.x the drive mounts but file transfers are spotty, mostly failing.
With Windows (XP) it seems fine. I don't have a Mac to test it with.
It's a good drive, seems reasonably fast. I don't use it for everyday, just periodic archives, so I don't need the fastest drive available, either.
Good storage size for the price, but of course, over time the cost will come down and the sizes of the drives will increase and someday we'll scoff at how we could have ever gotten by with just 300gb (the size I got), the same way we can no longer imagine the limits of a 40mb HDD, or the use of 5.25"" floppy disks, or punch cards, or cave paintings.",4.0

The nature sounds on this model are as realistic as any others I've tested out with the addition over older Timex models of a wind chime type sound.  This sound is a great one for people to use who don't wake up ""happy"" with a traditional buzzer type alarm.  This clock does have a buzzer alarm as well but it more a steady beeping that increases speed the longer it is allowed to sound.  I think this would be a good choice for those who tend to sleep very deeply.  There are three different alarms that can be set; one for radio, one for buzzer and one for nature sounds.  I routinely use three different alarm settings throughout the week and this clock handles all three so that I'm not constantly resetting the alarms every other night.  The sleep timer has a great enhancement that allows you to lower the volume on your sleep sound choice without changing the volume setting on your alarm.  In order to comfortably use the sleep timer on my old Timex model, I had to set the volume quite low.  This meant that the alarm volume for the next morning was too low and I failed to wake up on time.  I quit using my sleep timer at night for fear I'd oversleep again.

The instructions are weak, but easy to figure out how to connect the cameras.  The audio mic is located in the black housing on the wiring, and not on the camera body.  Don't tape the mic up with too much tape when taking up excess wire.  The audio is actually pretty good.  I had a camera like this earlier and I had it located to close to an outside light with too much tape covering the mic to protect against the rain.  It caused a buzzing noise for the audio.  Took off some of the tape and reloacted the camera a couple feet from the outside light, and that solved the problem.

11099254,"Last month i bought this unit and installed it on my own. The primary reason i bought this unit is because of car play. It now supports carplay with a firmware update. The firmware is around 2GB and require you to download it in a USB drive or SD Card and then put it in the slot. After couple of tries and 30 mins i was able to successfully install carplay and use it successfully.

Pros:

1) Carplay is breeze to use by just plugging in and using the known iphone iconic interface
2) HDMI port which can take in even a chromecast or any other HDMI input source
3) 2 USB ports - This is a big plus since you can have apple lightning adaptor in one slot and run another USB for non iphone devices
4) Fast response with reverse camera. This is on par with any factory unit. It only takes less than 2 sec to show the video feed from reverse camera
5) Can read SD cards over 32GB. With this you can load at least 20 movies and ready to use whenever you need

Cons

1) Carplay and non carplay interfaces are totally different. At times it takes a while to understand which mode it is in
2) If you connect the phone and the phone is locked then it displays the message and goes back into pioneer mode. If you don't unlock it immediately you have to unplug and plug it again
3) Support for non apple apps. Right now only spotify is supported... I need google maps in this

 I know this is version 1.0 of carplay and even the car manufacturers have not fully rolled out this. Pioneer and Apple has done a great job in getting this to old models such as mine which is 2001 Nissan pathfinder... I hope version 2.0 is also a firmware update and allows 3rd party apps so that we continue to use this unit instead of swapping it for a new one.",4.0

The only other thing that hinders it is that google and blackberry maps don't have turn by turn navigation. Superpages does. But like i said ive only got it to work once. But yea, i'd still recommend it. It's light weight, has a pretty decent to long battery life and comes with a usb charger and a car charger.

I want to be able to charge 1 at a time, leave it in there, and use it later.  I also wanted a way to take my older rechargeables and 'refresh' them.  This charger does all of that, it's perfect.

You simply put in 1 to 4 batteries and it figures out the optimal way to charge them to give them maximum life.  You can tweak settings to make it go faster, watch what level it's at, how long it's been going etc. but you don't need to.  If it's an older battery you can push the 'mode' button and flip it to 'refresh' and it takes a few days and boom, the battery is now acting like new.

This Acer is definitely the BEST one of the five 15.6"" in the $200-$250 price range.  All five have the same basic specs (Celeron / 500GHz / 4GB / 500GB) but the below specs give this an edge over the others.

PROS:

USB 3.0
- Dell doesn't have it, the rest do.
- Acer has one port.

Bluetooth
- Only Toshiba has it, the rest don't.
- Acer has Bluetooth 4.0.

Battery Life
- One Asus has 3.75 hr life, the rest range between 4-5.5.
- ACER HAS SEVEN FREAKING HOURS OF BATTERY LIFE!

Speaker
- The Toshiba and HP speakers suck big time! They are very low quality and thin.
- ACER HAS AN AMAZING SOUND SYSTEM FOR A LAPTOP! You don't need a speaker to get crisp sound with enough base.

Thinness/Sleekness/Appearance
- Toshiba is the thinnest and sleekest, the rest are at least 0.25-0.50 inch thicker.
- Toshiba and Asus have a bad case of finger marking! It is so disgusting to look at. The slightest touch leaves finger marks on it. HP and Dell are okay.
- Acer is almost as thin as the Toshiba, which makes it neat looking too.
- Acer repels finger marks, thus no disgusting finger marks on them!

CONS:

It burns all compatible discs flawlessly, including dual-layer. The drive is really compact and goes anywhere (without requiring an external power supply).

Wonderful, wonderful size.

Fabulous clarity and contrast.
Magnificent upgrade from 2 smaller monitors.

Cons:
Um... I got nothin'.

I just moved into a new house and got this monitor hooked up to my Surface Pro 3 on my new desk. Everything worked great and I cannot put into words how amazing this monitor is. I've been building my own business for several years and it's finally taking off like a rocket. While I may not have ""arrived"" just yet, this monitor is definitely something I've never had before (not even close) and it symbolizes my business' success. It's definitely a conversation starter (or maybe even a cardiac inducer) and I appreciate each and every one of the tiny pixels. They are like children to me and I wanted to pick out names for them, but I decided not to since that would make me seem like I've gone over the deep end. Well, maybe I have.

If you are used to having dual 1080p monitors (like I was for many years), you will really appreciate this monitor. No more dealing with all the cables and the setup and -- most importantly -- the gap between the two. This LG monitor eliminates that gap and even gives you a little more vertical space than you had before.

Unexpected bonus feature: When I first got this monitor setup, I hadn't yet hooked up my speakers, but decided to turn on Spotify -- I heard sound coming from under the monitor and was shocked! I didn't even know it had built-in speakers. While they aren't anything like having a good set of speakers with a subwoofer (which I don't have), they do actually sound pretty doggone good. Very surprising discovery and I may not even bother setting up my simple desktop speakers at this point.

If I haven't already made myself perfectly clear, I love this monitor. Maybe I'll name the pixels after all.

494397,"This was my first post-film camera, and it turned out to be a relatively easy transition. It's about the same size as the SLR film cameras I was accustomed to, albeit half the weight. It provides full manual controls once you decypher the menu protocol.
If you're into nature photography, as I am, the FZ10 is just about unbeatable. You can reach out with a 420mm equivalent for shots of birds or other wildlife and in macro you can take a portrait of a bug on a flower. Unbelievable!
The image-stabilization gyroscope combined with the Leica optics means you can take hand-held shots in daylight at full zoom that are super-sharp -- if you know how to squeeze a trigger.
Shutter lag is not a problem -- about 1 second betwen shots and the burst mode gives you 4 frames a second.
Downsides:
1. Poor low-light performance, common with digitals, is perhaps even more problematical with the FZ10, since it has no focus-assist light. (The internal flash is fairly good, and there's a hot shoe for something with more punch.)
2. It's not an SLR, so no interchangable lenses. (But if you need more than 420mm, use your feet!)
3. The proprietary battery is expensive, about $50, but they can last for a whole day of fairly heavy shooting.
4. Forget the lens cap (it's unattached so you're gonna lose it anyway) and get a 72mm skylight filter to protect that great Leica glass.",4.0

On top of that, because of its small size, certain characters can only be typed using a Function key instead of the Shift key, so it takes some time to get used to.

It transfers at a blazing 90 MBPS.  This PRO model uses MLC NAND Flash memory.  At less than $60, you need to stop reading the review and just order now.

I've been recording 4K in 422, and it takes a lot of memory.  With 64Gbytes I have enough SD space to get a dozen takes without having to interrupt filming to: shut down the camera, swap cards, and reboot the DC.  That might not sound like a big deal, but, when you're at location and the scene starts to click, you don't want to interrupt the flow for technical reasons.

This card is also extremely useful for the post-processing phase.  At 90 MBPS, I can download the entire card in less than ten minutes to my HP 800 Xenos.

When you increase the fidelity of the picture to 4K, data transfer glitches, etc., become blindingly obvious during editing.  This PRO is the first SD card that I have used that was able to record an entire shoot sequence without some residual artifacts.

My first 64 GByte, Class 6 SD card cost me over $90 with a fraction of the speed and reliability of this Class 10 SDXC for $60.

One caveat, some of your older SD recording devices are not going to be able to handle this card.  Before you spend the money, make sure your video equipment is compatible.

In a word, no range, no throughput and no customer service. Forget about 150 meters indoors, it drops off at about 10 meters, and that is line of sight! At that point the signal strength goes down to about 30% where it is unreliable.
Even when the PC is 5 feet from the access point, throughput is at about 1MBPS instead of 11 (even though the monitor claims its 11). Moving away doesn't reduce the speed. It stays at 11 all the way until it just disconnects.

The keyboard itself is what makes it. it's of the same quality you'd expect of a laptop, with backlit keys and a big touch pad that clicks. It has its own battery and will extend the battery life of the tablet when attached.

I'm mentioning the tablet itself second because in that regard, it's just what you'd expect. It is powerful with a strong CPU and nice amount of RAM. It has the power of a decent laptop, it's not like your typical mobile tablet or netbook.

It has some cons, however. For someone wanting it as a mobile tablet you plan on leaving the house with, this might not be for you. It's a very large screen and supposedly rather heavy. I couldn't imagine walking around and using it, but it's perfect as long as you plan on using it mostly sitting down.

Another con is that it has no USB ports on the actual tablet. This doesn't bother me as I use a USB mouse I already had, but would have only used it with the keyboard attached anyway. There's no way around it, though. This is a con, and could be a deal breaker for some.

One more con is that the screen is a bit awkward to detach. But you get the hang of it.

I've listed more cons than pros, but that's only because it really does what you'd expect out of a computer very well, and these are just very minor issues. I've been using this for about two weeks, and I've been very satisfied with it. Makes my life a lot easier and more comfortable.",5.0

Then we just tap the power button to put it in sleep mode, then tap again to wake up when we want to view the calendar. I haven't had it long enough to see if we really like it. I needed to have a google calendar in the kitchen instead of a wall calendar, which was always incorrect. I like that we can play Pandora on this and I can search recipes too.

165246,"I'm a computer tech. Early on in my career when I was doing hardware support and moves/adds/changes type stuff I found this Logitech Trackman Wheel mouse in a drawer in an abandoned cube. At the time I had tried a couple different kinds of ergo mice but hated them all. If I use a normal mouse or even a lot of other ""ergo"" mice my wrist cramps up like mad. I figured out early on if I was going to be working with computers all day for the rest of my career I better find a good mouse. This abandoned mouse has been a Godsend and has been faithful companion for over 10 years now.

Once I started using the mouse my wrist issues were gone immediately. The reason it works for me is because it nearly perfectly conforms to my hands' natural resting position. I'm not constantly using my wrist muscles to move the mouse around either. I have very limited desk space with my 3 monitors so it's really nice because it fits into small spaces, no need to have that extra room to move it around like a normal mouse.

After over 10 years of daily use the only thing to note is that the left click button isn't as crisp to click anymore. I little more pressure is needed on it now but not to the point where it's bothering me so hopefully I can still get another few years out of this guy. It'll be a sad day when it does go.

For some idiotic reason Logitech no longer makes this mouse as far as I can tell. They make a wireless version that appears very similar but I'd be happier with my good old Trackman Wheel. It's obvious that I'm not the only one that loves this mouse. They're going for 5 times the original cost so that should be a good indicator that Logitech should get back on the horse...",5.0

The biggest factor that lead me to purchase this card is the size.  It's about 1"" shorter than your typical 4850.  This allowed me to use this card in my small HTPC case.

My first impression is that the grip is made of cheap plastic, especially the battery trays. I am very afraid of how long this will last and I am sure that one fumble with it will cause it to break. With that said, it gets the job done. I do wish it held both batteries in the grip like Canon's version does. It is a pain to have to remove the grip to get the other battery out for charging.

Nikon does have a feature in the menu that lets you tell the camera which battery to use first and this works to keep you from having to remove the second battery for charging but on long shoots you are screwed. I know it is a small gripe and as stated the grip works.

It seems to be fairly well built and durable with a couple of areas that could be looked at again to ensure quality. The cable sheathing seems to be a little weak mainly around the spots that it connects to the charging pieces. The way that the cable also bends around the casing so that it can be stored could potentially cause problems with the wiring becoming exposed or bending too much, but as long as it is kept in good condition and it is not abused too much it seems like it should last. Also make sure to follow the directions on which pieces should come out first and be put away first (Micro-USB pulled out first and put back last, USB pulled out last and put back first). The USB and Micro-USB pieces are very sturdy and do not seem like they will bend or break off like I have had other cables do before.

If you are buying this expecting to get Samsung/Apple quality, you should take another look at the price tag. I can't get a 5 year old iPod for fifty bucks, and used first gen iPad sare still over $100! So with the price tag at the forefront of my mind, is this a good tablet? Well, it depends. The speakers are awful, the screen is lower than expected quality, and the system itself lacks the power for certain applications.

Here are some real-world tests that may help you make your decision:

NETFILX
Barely powerful enough for Netflix. Will only play in standard definition and every now and then will stutter. Without headphones, sound is way too low for viewing.

BROWSING/FACEBOOK/SOCIAL STUFF
Just fine, although this demands less of the tablet so I expected it to run a little more smoothly. If you're just wanting to scroll through facebook and check your email, this is not a bad choice for the price.

GAMING
Don't buy this tablet for gaming, particularly for newer games. The original angry birds runs fine, but I tried Jetpack Joyride and was greeted with stuttering video every now and then (which for gaming means you're pretty much done).

SPOTIFY
Worked just fine, with audio going to external speakers of course.

OVERALL
It simply does not have enough power for my liking. Browsing was okay, as was Facebook but any stronger demands on the graphics card elicit a response not unlike when a puppy doesn't want to walk any further...

For Spotify, my only real use for this, it's just fine. As a starter tablet, or a first and inexpensive children's tablet, it will work fine. For browsing and Facebook, again - just fine. For anything heavier though, including watching movies and Netflix, you may want to look elsewhere. Amazon designates three stars as ""it's okay"", and that about sums it up for me.",3.0

They also have a unique plug design that is large and easy to grip, but still fits through most phone or tablet cases, so you won't have to remove your case for the best connection.

Personally I'm uncomfortable with how tight the Micro USB plug fits. I wouldn't recommend it for something you'll be connecting and disconnecting frequently. For things that will stay connected most of the time, and for devices that may have connection problems, these will probably be great.",4.0

6393677,"This review is for one with TH02 panel with 1018 firmware.  This tv get's one star off for relatively low contrast, low brightness, narrow viewing angle and cheap flexible bezel and another for user interface/ease of use.

I searched for large screen tv for a while.  I really wanted plasma as I like blacks to be black, large viewing angles and vibrant color.  However I had to write plasma off almost immediately when it become apparent that I cannot stand plasma flicker.  In addition, Viera ST had been discontinued and models similar in price where too glossy.

As it become clear that LED is for me I zeroed in on either LG or Samsung.  I would have preferred LG (IPS panel, 3D) if not for uneven back-light.  Since I did not mind thick case I settled for Samsung EH.

Speaking of back-light Samsung's is not entirely even either but it's barely visible as it's outside of the picture (black bars).

The TV can look great once tweaked to source and offers satisfactory flesh tones and balanced if  a little flat colors.  Unfortunately each of the two HDMI ports can only have one profile.  That's not enough.  Adding insult to the injury features like brightness, backlight, motion plus, R/G balance are hard to access from the remote and on screen menus are s l o w, unresponsive.

Brightness deserves a separate mention.  In a daylight lit room (no direct sunlight) brightness is satisfactory at 12-18.  This makes blur reduction feature (LED strobe) useless since maximum level is 20.

Also worth mentioning is dynamic contrast and brightness.  I read few opinions that such features should be disabled.  When those features are off the panel is too gray and colors are flat so to me mentioned features save this product from getting two stars instead of three.",3.0

The C8 I owned had issues with heat plumes and would take upwards of 2 hours to cool down in winter.

The entire clock display is illuminated, which is a minus if you prefer a dark bedroom at night.  On the plus side, it can easily be set to one of three brightness levels at a push of a button, and it's not too annoying at night on the lowest level.

The radio in the Sony ICFC705 is top notch.  I live in an area near several broadcast towers, and most radios are swamped by their signal and are unable to tune in most stations.  The ICFC705 manages to tune in most stations clearly and with decent sound.

Regretfully, if you want to wake to something other than radio, this is not the unit for you.  Both the buzzer and melodies are at a preset volume that cannot be adjusted by the volume control (a very strange design decision that ruins the usefulness of this clock radio).

This wouldn't be too bad if they were loud or if they built up to a loud volume over time.  But both the buzzer and melodies are rather quiet and will not wake a sound sleeper.

3799179,"Got the camera at Costco for a deal because I had a coupon for some extra savings and I was going to the Virgin Islands, and really wanted to use the under water feature. I got the camera about 1 week before going on vacation and started taking pictures of my dog and what not, and while uploading the pictures to my computer, I noticed a small white dot on each one. This was a ""bad"" pixel. I tested it several times after that and still noticed that white pixel was still on the pictures, so I then took it back and exchanged it for another one (a Black one) because these things happen sometimes, not really a big deal.

So I tested the second camera before going to the Virgin Islands, and it worked great, so off I went. -- Used the camera under water and took some awesome pictures. Did this for about 4 days, and noticed something very strange and frustrating... I could not turn on the camera anymore by holding down the power button. I took out the battery and placed it back in, and then it turned on, but I could not turn off the camera. Thinking I got sand down in there or something, I washed it out with warm running watter (remember it is water proof) and this help some what, but still, I had to hold the power button for a longer period of time and sometimes had to press it several times before it would turn on and off.

I pretty much dealt with this the last 2 days of my trip and really like the pictures, but this was the second time I had technical problem with the camera that I could not fix. -- Call support and they sucked, they just referred me to the troubleshooting and really did not listen to my problem. The troubleshooting steps were very basic steps that I actually already complete (battery recharging, taking the battery out, etc.), but I have decided to take the camera back and get a different one.

2427539,"This unit performs reasonably well.  Here are the main downsides:

1.  The unit has the ability to record all tracks from a DVD to the HD, as indicated on p. 53 of the manual.  This would be useful for say dubbing a home movie DVD to HD so you could re-edit or reburn a different disk with different tracks for other family members.  If you have say 40 short clips to dub, this feature would be great since you could start it and let it copy all 40 tracks (""titles"" in DVD lingo).  Unfortunately it doesn't work.  Well, it works, but only if the DVD you want to dub from is writable (has room left to record and is not finalized), which will not often be the case.  This makes more sense if you are trying to dub from the HD to the DVD.  But from DVD to HD? Why is this necessary?  The company won't say.  They just say it's just not designed to do that even though the manual says otherwise.  So instead you have to do an analog copy from another DVD player, then break up the single full disk play into individual tracks - very time consuming.  Or you could use the one-at-a-time dubbing feature, 40 times.  Also time consuming.

2. When you finalize a disk (DVD), there is an entry for an empty track.

My worst peeve is the volume adjustment slider. As it has already been mentioned, this does not ajust the iPhone's (or whatever your gadget) volume, but rather the output volume. So you may need to put your device's volume at maximum, and then adjust down with the slider. However, I find that the slider control is too loose, so it is very easy for the volume to go unintentionally out of adjustment and even go all the way down so you can't hear anything, and it may take you a few moments to realize that you need to bring the volume back up.

5459282,"I have swum about 200 laps now with this and I am still amazed at how much more enjoyable lap swimming is while listening to music.  I purchased the earbuds with this and here's my advice.  Try the different sizes of tips to make sure you get the best fit.

Put a little petroleum jelly on the tip (not in the hole) to help.

Do not try to jam the tips in your ears in an attempt to get a water tight seal.  You will hurt yourself.

Grab a box of silicon ear plugs.  Since these are going I your ear holes, you can reuse the same silicon over and over.

After you put the tips in your ears, take a silicon plug and smash it around the outside of the tip and the outer ear.  This will form a great seal and provide you with really amazing sound.

Lastly, in might take you a couple of tries to get all this right.  I can swim 50+ laps with a great seal.  I will occasionally do a little mashing between turns but I don't have to constantly mess with it.

I would certainly recommend this product and have really enjoyed using it.",5.0

Try as you might, there will be little bits of dust that wind up under the screen protector as you're applying it.  Use the white sticky sheet as a tool to lift the corners of the screen protector, and then dab at the dust with the white sticky sheet, which will pull the dust off.  Repeat until the screen protector is on perfectly with no dust or air bubbles.  Keep the white sticky sheet on the plastic bag and save it for whenever you put the second screen protector on.

Getting this thing on was a PITA, as I wanted it perfect.  Using the technique above I was able to get it on with no dust specks or air bubbles so that you can't even tell it's on there.

I bought this because somebody wrote a review saying it doesn't show finger oil like the bare screen does.  That oil on the screen is a pet peeve of mine, and the only negative to the ipod besides the short battery life.  This protector does do an excellent job of hiding the oil, FOR A WHILE, but over time the oil accumulates so that you can see it when the screen is dark; you don't notice it when the screen is lit up.  At that point wiping the oil off with a cloth doesn't seem to get it all, so putting a little Windex on a soft cloth and wiping the screen is necessary.

The fluid motion it provides is amazing, and comparable to actual professional production camera cranes on the market. It's extremely easy to operate, and will give you professional results every time.

The monitor provided is okay, unless your shooting a movie, it'll do. If you want to use a different monitor, I suggest buying everything separately, which will save you a lot of money in the long run.

PROS:
Sturdy, strong, and versatile
Easy to operate
Can accommodate cables attached to crane
Can mount on basically any standard speaker stand.
Great quality

CONS:
Powder coating scratches easily
Not easy to setup by yourself
Crane parts does not fit easily into carrying case

13322052,"My main problem with this audio interface is that its preamps are kind of noisy.  I compared Steinberg UR12 to my other two interfaces - Roland Tri-Capture and Avid Fast Track Solo - and UR12's preamps were the worst in terms of added noise/hiss (the preamps in all interfaces were set to the same gain during testing).  In addition, Steinberg UR12 only provides 44 dB of gain, which is not enough for low output dynamic microphones like Shure SM57 and AKG D5, unless you literally scream into the microphone.  Steinberg's support also leaves a lot to be desired.

On the positive side, this interface is very well built and does not cost an arm and a leg.  It also comes with Cubase AI, which is a pretty good DAW.

1104993,"Apple has done a spendid job in taking the old iPod mini's aluminum case and putting it on the nano instead. I would really say that this new nano is more like a shrunken ipod mini, except with a bottom headphone jack (which I personally don't like). With the aluminum case, this nano is less-prone to scratches compared to the 1st-gen nano and the video ipod.  I got my nano today and I've already played about 4 hours of music with the battery gauge now at I'd say 80%. So the battery should be impressive, probably not the 24 hrs that Apple says but still decent. The interface now allows you the search for your music instantaneously, just like you can in iTunes. However, I wish Apple had put a built-in FM tuner instead of making us buy the little remote. I also was disappointed to see the 8gb come only in black; I really wanted a blue nano, but I also don't want 4gb. The black does still look pretty cool, I will admit that. Overall, I think this is the best non-video iPod to date. Apple definitely should be able to sell thousands of this model (I would say even more if there was a better color selection).  As of today (only 2 days after the release), many of the 1st-gen ipod nano accessories are compatible with the 2nd-gen nano, but because Apple slightly shifted the positions of the headphone jack and dock connector port, there are a few accessories (notably cases and armbands) which are not quite compatible.

14745011,"This is an amazing graphics card for the 1080p gaming group. I absolutely love this card with the performance that it provides me and how cool it runs. It runs most games I play at 60fps with the exception of GTA V which it runs at an average of 54 fps. With this GPU paired along with the FX 6300, you have a solid, mid range computer that can run any game at 1080p. You might not be able to crank up all of the eye candy effects for some games but you can still have very high settings on games without some of the more taxing settings turned on. The only issue that I run into with this card is when you turn on MSAA anywhere above 4x you run into micro stutters left and right. This might just be a driver issue or just the fact that multisampling that much taxes a lot of VRAM. If you want to hop on the 4k bandwagon you can run CS:GO on 4k @ 60fps, other than that I don't expect that you can achieve playable frame rates at 4k on any other game. In conclusion, this is a beast of a card and can run anything at 1080p like a champ. If you don't expect to play games at 4k then you will be happy with this card, if you expect this card to be able to run games at 4k then you need to raise your price range to the $600-$1000 range.

I conducted some careful research on what sound cards are compatible with Vista and Windows 7. I thought the Diamond Xtreme Sound 5.1 card would take care of my needs while staying within a tight budget. I bought the sound card, took it home, installed it, installed the driver, and rebooted my PC. I was very disappointed with the sound after the reboot process was completed. The audio sounded like it was inside a large metal pipe or room - clearly not what I wanted to hear. I tried to adjust the environment settings to no avail. I uninstalled the driver for the card, downloaded another similar driver for that card, and rebooted the PC. The audio sounded a little better, but the metal echoing was still there. I went to the website of the company that made my obsolete sound card I still had. The website had no drivers for Vista so I spent some time searching for other links that might show me where I could find a driver to work in Vista. After a few minutes of searching, I found and downloaded a driver for the obsolete sound card.  I yanked out the Diamond sound card, put in my obsolete Turtle Beach Catalina card, booted up my PC, installed the Vista driver for the Catalina card, and rebooted my PC. I was very happy to hear audio again - clear and natural with no noise artifacts.

Who would have guessed?) I believed the company advertising on the Velocity 8. It was one of the few bags that claimed to hold a digital SLR with lens and grip attached. And the sling idea seemed like a good idea as well. Well, the bag will hold the camera with lens and grip attached, but so would a paper sack from Piggly Wiggly. There seems to have been about as much design involved. There is no particular support for the camera, other than the standard Velcro attached dividers. You can stuff it in pretty much any way you want to, but it never really seems to fit in any kind of secure fashion. True, it will hold a good amount of gear, but the top only access is awkward, and you end up digging into the bottom of the bag with no real organization options for lenses, filters, etc. And don't even get me started on the sling strap. It not only doesn't work very well, it makes it difficult to even carry the bag. It can't just be thrown over your shoulder when you need to run. And don't even try to put it on over a jacket. You need to be a bit of a contortionist to get your head and arm through the strap. If there was at least a quick-release buckle on the strap it would help. The bag's flat profile is nice, but wasted. Plus, the round bottom makes it impossible to set the bag down to open it up. It ends up lying on its back, or sort of, since the big fat sling strap sticking out the back won't actually let you lay it down flat. The advertising sounded great!

Ok, so the covers are made from thin cardboard- I could deal with that as overall it looks good and there is a nice leather area inside to hold my iPad. Here's my major gripe: the zippers are absolute crap. I gently tried to close them & they left gaps (i.e. the zipper teeth started coming apart) straight away! The same with the other zipper!! There are probably better zippers on a pair of jeans from a dollar store in China! So disappointed as I waited in anticipation for so long to have it delivered and it's junk. How can it be used without zippers (or some other way) to close?

There are other reviewers here that had the same issue... I should have listened to them... will you listen to me?

Also, the box it was sent in was way too big for the case & there was no packing material (not even newspaper) for protection so the case was probably banging around inside the box during delivery & that's why a corner was bent.

I ordered the ""EXMAX Tripod Mini Ball Head for DSLR Camera Camcorder Light Bracket Swivel 1/4"" Screw"" when I ordered the dolly, and it works great.  It holds my DSLR fine, everything is secure, and it gives me the ability to adjust the angle a bit for the shot I'm doing.",5.0
9754040,"I bought this with several sources swearing that it is one of the best routers you can buy.

It is not. I have had this for only a few days and only had issues with it. My old router (Linksys EA2700) had no issues with the modem/ISP, but the Nighthawk AC1750 does not function as intended at all. I have only had it work for brief periods of time before it no longer has connectivity despite the modem showing it works just fine. Upon troubleshooting, Windows complains that the DNS servers aren't being found, despite setting it both to ""Auto"" as well as the usual 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 tried-and-true DNS servers. Identical settings on the Linksys Router work perfectly.

The Nighthawk is a very large unit that has 3 very large external antennae, which lends to higher connectivity throughout your residence. Setting up the unit itself was easy, and the power brick is fairly small compared to older units. It has the standard 4 ports for ethernet cables, and one port in the front for USB. It's roughly a foot across, so it takes up a good amount of space. You can turn off the LEDs in the settings when connected to the router.

I have troubleshot this router for hours and come to no real solution, even when updating firmware. While possible I received a defective unit, I have no desire to continue using the Nighthawk Router, regardless of replacement. I will definitely be returning it and looking elsewhere, or just keeping my EA2700.",1.0
2074934,"I recently purchased the ATH-ANC3 in-ear headphones for use in a noisy lab environment where I work (about 68-70dB).  The lab consist of several hundred pieces of telecom equipment and servers, the noise level of the lab is equivalent of running your vacuum cleaner in your home.  The ATH-ANC3 headphones work TERRIFIC!!!  I am extremely impressed with them.  They block out almost all of the equipment fan noise.  The low end fan noise is completely blocked, and the high end server whine is almost completely blocked.  These phones are noise-canceling, so don't expect other people's conversations to be completely blocked (you will still be able to hear when people talk, but you probably will not be able to understand them).

I have used them with my iPod Nano, and they work great.  I typically have to listen to my iPod at 1/2 to 2/3 volume using the iPod earbuds to be able to hear the music in my lab; however, with the ATH-ANC3 headphones, I only have to turn my iPod to 1/4 or 1/3 volume (a vast improvement).  If you are listening to music with the noise canceling on, it will all but block out EVERYTHING going around you.

The specs on this card are no mystery. Of course a power supply of 400+ is needed. That is the case for the majority of graphics cards.
In addition, of course you should download drivers from AMDs website rather than the disk. I understand there's a learning curve to do it yourself projects, but reviews should not blame a product due to this. Not that there can't be a bad card, but some of the bad reviews here are not based on the card.
This is a solid card which is capable of running DX 11 as well so it won't be obsolete soon. Don't expect it to be an enthusiast card. It is intended for mainstream PC owners who like to game as well, but do not demand the expensive cutting edge technology. For the mainstream PC owner, this type of card is all that's needed. It is not sensible to install a $300+ graphics card on a PC that has basic hardware through the rest of it anyway.
This card plays all my games on high. These are relatively new releases.  And I anticipate it being able to play the majority of games (admitingly on lower settings) for the next couple years.
Important things to consider: know your PC specs and do a little research for compatibility.  If you don't have a power supply strong enough, the compatible Windows version, enough RAM, or the latest drivers installed from the internet, don't expect the card to work.

For those experiencing a laggy system after installing, this is a result of the kernel_task process using up the CPU power because it detects an unsupported component. I found this on macrumors forums so I thought I would post it here to save others some time:

The drivers are absolute garbage. On the fly sensitivity stops working very, very often. The only fix is to reinstall the drivers and reboot. Sometimes you must do this several times in a row before they will work.

Razer support is completely worthless, they will tell you to do the most inane and common troubleshooting steps for the most ridiculous of noobs. When reinstalling their drivers doesn't work, they basically have you RMA.

18946868,"Well, I guess I must counter all of the other reviewers because I have had really good luck with the refurbished Insignia DVD player that I purchased about 4 months ago. I bought this for my young son's room and he has uses this player nightly and quite often during the day. So he has used it close to 200 times since I purchased it. I haven't had any problems with it recognizing disks or gapping-out at all. I have actually been quite impressed with what DVDs my son has expected this player to read with how many scratches some of them have, but it has performed nicely so far. The remote is responsive and all of the controls work as they should. If I have problems in the near future I will update this review, but so far I am glad that I took a chance after reading the ratings. This has turned out to be a good little machine for a great price!

As for the condition it arrived in to compare to other reviewers: It arrived fully sealed in the package with all of the cords and the remote nicely wrapped in individual bags, the DVD player was well protected in a brand new product box and the product manual and accessories were crisp and brand new. All of the cables were included to easily connect it to my son's television. Nothing was mission. There were no signs of previous use on this refurbished DVD player.

I purchased this device from the seller ""newtownvideos"" through the Amazon Warehouse. I am unsure who others have used, but I'm glad I bought mine from them after hearing some stories! You might want to look into buying from them if you thinking of purchasing this item.

Also- it would be helpful if those with negative reviews could post in their review what seller they used.

It is not better and I am going to return it for another 305.

The instructions are terrible!  Nothing in there says you need to push the ""start"" button to access the functions.  Installing the Ant+ stick is a nightmare because the manual does not say that you need to access settings on the watch to get it to sync; I also needed to download 3 upgrades to software to do this. I ended up spending 30 minutes on the phone with tech support; they are open until 7 pm CT M through Th although their website says 6 pm, and best to call later in the week.

The real problem is the bezel is hyper sensitive at times, and unresponsive at others, so that when I tried to set a field, it would sometimes go back without any touch from me and change itself.  Getting it to work for a workout was a nightmare; I could not do it.  It appears I need to spend 5 minutes setting it up for each workout.  On the 305, I just press start and I am ready to go.

Our antenna has finally stopped working; the amplifier stopped working and a coat hanger can get better reception.  I took the unit apart and this is what I've been able to figure out so far.

* The flat PCB is about 1x1' and poorly constructed.  Low grade PCB, weak solder points as well as improperly soldered points, and materials were starting to oxidize.
* Coax cable going from the antenna to the amplifier, as well as the coax from the amplifier to the end you plug into your receiver, is un-shielded coax that is highly susceptible to local electromagnetic interference.

10403720,Perfect book case for Samsung Note Pro 12.2 tablet.  The quality exceeded my expections for this case!  Case will turn off tablet when closed and stitching is without flaw and looks like a leather case but is imitation leather and interior is microfiber.  For what I paid for case I would definitely recommend everybody buy this case.  I usually buy only the highest quality items but since this is not for an Apple iPad your not getting gouged for this and is better than case for my iPad that also was very good but so much more expensive.,5.0

Original review:
Bought as a christmas gift for my daughter since my son has the same model and is very happy with it.  However, the one we got would not charge or turn on, only one earpiece working in wired mode.  Returned, requesting replacement.  Will update this review if replaced.

Updates:
Returned, no option for replacement so I got the refund and re-ordered, this time specifically selecting Avantree_Direct as the vendor.  Received them today.  Charging works fine, wired test on variety of music was impressive.  I used some acapella pieces, instrumentals and others to get a range of types.  Good bass, clean highs, pretty decent sound isolation.  It just fits over my ears, but since it is for my daughter, it should have room to spare.

I then tested the Bluetooth pairing with my android tablet.  No problem, audio is fine.  Tried out the microphone as well, as others have noted it is not great, but considering there is no boom for it, just a pickup in the headset, it isn't bad.  The main thing this will be used for is listening anyway, not for the phone functions, so that is not an issue.

With the Ceiva frame, they get pictures of my brood every week - and my brother, in yet ANOTHER state, sends pictures of his family as well.  My mom gets the weather every morning too.  Never had a single problem with it, and she LOVES it!  We bought her a very reasonably priced lifetime subscription, and now there is no additional fees, ever.

18810050,"Installed the system with six door/window contacts and two motion sensors. I needed help when four of the sensors gave an error message (""Repeated Code"") whenever I tried to assign the sensors to a zone setting because several sensors had the same address. Asked for help and received an immediate response and instructions on how to change the jumper settings. Used a T-Mobile SIM card for the cellular connection and signed up for their $10 three-month plan (33 minutes). Noticed a couple of things when the I had the cell phone connection active and tested the alarm. 1. The system called my phone each time any of the sensors tripped. I also received separate calls whenever I armed or dis-armed the system. This can quickly ring up a lot of minutes and drain the t-mobile pre-pay account in no time... 2. The voice messages are difficult to understand, so skipped the voice messages and use text messages instead.

** My Story **
I'm in the tech industry but have a fairly casual setup at home. My cable provider (AT&T U-Verse) gave me a modem/router combo. The problem is it's stuck in the master closet which makes it also surrounded on almost all sides by bathroom walls and pipes and the fireplace. That means the wifi signal is dead in some parts of the house and ok in others. Super frustrating.

So, I did some research and I bought an Apple Airport Extreme. Excellent reviews. After installing it, the speed and signal strength were better (not a ton but better) BUT now none of my devices could connect to it. There is a common bug with the Airport that doesn't accept the wifi password you set up. Unbelievably frustrating.

So THEN I ordered the OnHub. Returned the Airport Extreme. In a former dead spot with the original router, or in a spot that got just 3Mbps with the Airport Extreme, the OnHub was giving me 200+Mbps speeds! I've been highly impressed with the stability of the connection, strength / distance of the connection (all the way out to the street in front of my house), and how easy the app makes setup and management. Highly recommended!",5.0

1691977,"ORIGINAL: Just my opinion, but I think the LNT4065F is a better value right now (as of 02/2008) until ""true"" 120hz LCD HDTVs are widely available in the US.  This TV has a beautiful picture but why pay the extra money for 120hz when it cannot due 5:5 pulldown of 24p sources and can cause the Triple Ball Effect.  The 120hz is a useless feature unless you have a true 120hz source input.  Sources that are not 120hz (such as 1080p24 or 1080p60, ALL Blu-Ray/HD-DVD MOVIES) can be ""distorted"" by the interpolated frames causing the appearance of ghosting/shadowing (Casanova HD notebook scene).  Because there are NO US LCD HDTVs that currently support 5:5 pulldown (and I have checked extensively), I am buying the LNT4065F for now and will buy a new model 52"" or 57"" once the 120hz and LED dimming have been perfected in a year, moving the 40"" to the bedroom.

EDIT:
[...]
Just read forum.blu-ray.com and after a professional review, it has been determined that the statement in the product manual ""disabling the Auto Motion feature results in 60hz"" is incorrect; this HDTV always functions at a native 120hz.  This HDTV CAN perform accurate 5:5 pulldown of 24p content IF AND ONLY IF Auto Motion Plus is set to off.  I now amend my review to state that this HDTV can be worth the extra money for the videophile film purist if you leave the Auto Motion Plus feature off (at all times).

Quirks: This unit has a few. Arbitrarily, I get no sound from any input source, radio, usb, bluetooth. A restart typically fixes this. This unit's sound staging does not play nice with bose, but it's not really its fault that bose amps are nuts.

3718690,"This little radio has had some great reviews.  One thing a potential purchaser should remember is that this radio has two small lithium ion batteries located inside it and they need to be recharged periodically by using the attached hand crank or the solar panel mounted on top of the unit.  You can't buy this small radio and put it in your emergency kit and have it work for you months or years down the road when needed.  It doesn't work that way.  It needs to be used and the batteries recharged periodically, I would guess within a 90 day period of time.  From the other reviews I have read from those who have purchased this little radio, they keep it on a window sill where it can get some sun light every day, that will keep the batteries charged using the small attached solar panel on the radio.  My wife couldn't figure out why the radio wouldn't work the other day when she tried to turn it on and show some friends how it worked.  She hasn't used the radio since she first bought it several years ago thinking we wouldn't need it until an emergency situation presented itself.  How wrong she was, we both learned a valuable lesson.  The hand crank and solar panel are there to charge up the batteries located inside the unit.  The batteries will fail if you don't use the radio periodically.",5.0

Its great storage device with a SD and DF cards slots so you can dump and view photos on the go. Great way to view photos and video other than passing around the camera.

While not all files are viewable it will ""take"" any file format. You can take all you pictures and video off your digital camera without missing a beat. Very functional. Also you can record video which is great for watching movies on a plane.

What its not:
A professional photo viewer. It can handle RAW and JPEG but the quality is not something you want to judge you images on. Again its great to just dump photos and then share them. It can play music but its not an ipod. It has a great ""playlist"" feature but it is difficult to manage 30 gigs of music for instance.

3949508,"This is exactly what we call Chinese junk. Don't be cheap and buy the Kenko if you have the cash. If you don't, save up and get the Kenko.  It is very frustrating to pay as much as I did for these just to find out they don't work.
This review is based on my experience with a 5D mark II and canon 100mm f2.8 USM macro (non-IS) lens.
I went the cheap way and bought these instead of the better Kenko ones out there and I got what I paid for. Luckily I found a used set of Kenko here for $99 and grabbed it to replace these. So I'm reviewing these after testing out the Kenko and I know how much the Zeiko set sucks.

First, and the deal breaker, with all 3 rings attached in any combination, AF and aperture did not work.  I could live without AF for macro but *NO APERTURE CONTROL* was why I returned these. This tells me they used cheap contacts with high resistance in these so not enough voltage reaches the lens.  With two rings in any combination it worked *alright* meaning most of the time the aperture would activate and 1 out of probably 10 shots it would not.  AF also worked with two rings but it was obvious it was not getting the power it needs.

Second, the mounts are all cheap plastic.  Structurally they're sufficient BUT molded plastic can NEVER be as precise as machined metal mounts and it causes tolerance issues. Some fittings can be very very tight to the point where it doesn't feel natural putting on a ring or putting the lens on the ring.  Some may choose to live with this, I would too if electrical contacts worked.

So if you want to use these you'll have to have a lens with an aperture ring to set aperture manually or do the ""mount lens on camera, press and hold aperture button while removing the lens to get the aperture stuck"" but that is a PIA when paying this much money. If you want to go that route you might as well get the photodiox ones for $11.95.

First off, like some other reviewers mentioned, it doesn't hold a charge for very long. I circumvented this issue by making sure to keep the charger around whenever I used the tablet. This was expected, so I didn't let it bug me.

I had tried many ways to group the cords out of the way such as binder clips and twist ties, but they would pinch the cords preventing them from sliding easily if I needed to adjust something. They also allowed cords to droop in various spots which made places where they would tangle. This sleeve is very easy to wrap around the cords, holding them together yet allowing them to slide freely within the tube. The velcro makes removal quick and easy if necessary and also makes the tube reusable as well. There are slots in the neoprene allowing cords to exit where they need to so you can set up your desk in the most convenient way for you. I am very pleased with this product and the fact I do not have to worry about unplugging things now when I sit as my desk!

I wasn't disappointed. The build quality is good and the kit does everything I would expect of it. If I had a gripe I would have liked a silver umbrella rather than gold but that is easily remedied.

Also, I had a very hard time getting one of the two alarms to stick on my door. It fell off 5 times. Then I tried using a command strip and it still fell off.

I'm no audiophile but I've never heard this quality audio from any kind of earbud. Nothing even close.  I was really surprised. 2) They fit really well.  They stay put in my ears when I'm running, and they're so comfortable, I don't feel like I'm wearing anything.  In fact, when I got home from my run, I forgot that I had them on and was walking around the house with them.  3) I'm not sure where the microphone is, but it works really well.  People I talked to on the phone said that they had no problem hearing me.  They had no idea that I was talking to them thru a bluetooth headset.  4) Price. Can't believe they're less than $27.

4316420,"I bought this pair of earphones and philips shs8100.

The good: the wires are hard to tangle, the earhooks are impossible to shake off (I went crazy jumping and shaking my head and bewildering my 2 yr old), they have a little clip on them so you can clip them on your shirt, you can shorten the length of the section where the wire seperates, you can wash them (wow!), it sounds good (I am not an audiophile but they beat my old neon green headphones that look like this by Philips that came with my CD walkman years ago.)

However, when I compared to them to the philips shs8100, I discovered that the shs8100 has much better sound and feel lighter and more comfortable on my ears. On both headphones I used the smallest rubber tip for insertion into the ear canal.

Both headphones, when I shook the wire as I listened to music had degradation in quality. I could hear the wire moving, like when someone fumbles with their microphone. However this was mitigated by the clip you could clip to your shirt.

Now, shs8100 did not come with the clip or case to store it in, but since they are my favorite I simply took them from the philips shq3000 and was able to use them just fine.

Since these 2 headphones are so similar in price, I recommend the shs8100 by philips over these for general purpose use. The only downside to the 8100 is that they seemed slighty more likely to fall off, they don't have a ""tangle-free"" cord, they aren't so water-resistant, and don't come with a clip or case.  However if you are a hard-core sports person, I can see sacrificing the sound and comfort a bit and choosing the 3000.",4.0

They were not kidding in listing 25 oz in the spec sheet.  In my measurement it was even heavier than that, at 27 oz.  I guess all the USB power has to be provided by some heavy equipment.

I debated on whether to get an Ipod or the Samsung. Samsung products are usually excellent and this is no exception. The player is very well made and I believe the quality and ease of use are up to par with the Ipod. I actually thought it was easier to navigate the YH-920 than the Ipod as I found on my friends Ipods that the touch wheel was so sensitive. The Samsung is much easier to navigate and the extra features are really cool.  The FM radio is very good and it is fun to be able to record on the fly.  I did not have any problem installing the player as I followed the instructions. I did however find the Napster software totally useless with very little functionality unless you plan on only downloading their music. Use windows media player 9.0 or higher and you will have much better luck organizing you mp3's.  Napster had the crapiest MP3 id tag labeling I have ever seen! Windows media player works much better for importing you current MP3's.

I have no idea why and the manufacturers are no help.  I contacted them before regarding the fact that the clock will not stay on...it just won't, they have no idea of how to make it stay on giving me the time.  Anyway, I left the area for a bit and my wife was using my truck.  She would use the BT religiously.  Then a couple of days ago it wasn't connecting.  She tried all the quick fixes, from resetting her phone to restarting the car.  She even selected to ""forget the device"" to make it pop back up, and nothing!!!  For whatever reason the unit is no longer transmitting a signal to connect to.  Its so sad that we allow poorly made stuff to be sold to Americans.

3584621,"I reviewed the PowerShot SX200 IS a short while ago on Canon's and Amazon's website and rated it very highly.  Nonetheless, I decided to return it in exchange for the PowerShot SX20 IS.

This camera offers the following additional advantages: a viewfinder; HD video recording with optical zoom throughout the zoom range plus stereo sound; a form factor much more like that of an SLR: it is on the heavy side, but easy to hold and the viewfinder allows you to hold the camera against your body which adds extra stability, and thus better focus, especially when zooming in;  diapter adjustability means I don't have to wear glasses when using the EVF; the LCD display can be closed so it faces the camera - no need to worry about smudging or scratching it.

Those who are considering the purchase of an SLR need to keep in mind that you'll need at least three different lenses to get a comparable zoom range.  You'd be lugging around quite a bit of weight, and faced with the delay in changing lenses depending upon what you want to take a picture of.

Some question the quality of the pictures it takes.  Keep in mind that this is not a camera designed for amateurs who insist on fully automatic features. In other words, the best possible pictures may only be obtained when you make needed adjustments ranging from setting the scene yourself to fully manual ones, or else by using a photo editor.

So far, I have taken perhaps one hundred test pictures and ten minutes of video.  Unless you intend to print or view the pictures beyond 11"" x 14"", I doubt that you will notice any difference between the results this camera produces and an SLR.  I've owned the Olympus e-510, and can say that you'd have to magnify or crop to a degree that most users simply don't in order to notice a difference.  The quality of the videos is much better than that of my standard definition Canon DC230 mini-DVD camera.  The downside is the weight of this camera, which makes extended filming somewhat difficult (for me, at least).

I highly recommend the camera for those who are looking for the characteristics I have highlighted. It is probably one of the best, if not the best, super-zooms on the market today.",5.0

The Magellan Roadmate 2000 has only one good thing about it. The voice is nice and clear and sounds like a human being - THAT'S IT! That's the only thing that's nice about it.

It told me that left was right and right was left, it couldn't find obvious streets in my own town that have been there for years. I asked it to find a Walmart nearest me (as a test). There are like 6 Walmarts in my city! The closest one in recommended to me was in the NEXT city over 100 miles away! WHAT??? And the on screen graphics look like a video game from the early 1980's, I could hardly tell what I was looking at! It was trying to insert little graphics of forks and knives (for restraunt) and a car (for auto service) and it looked so bad that it was more confusing that anything.

The funniest thing about this GPS was that I emailed tech support and they emailed me back telling me to update the software (which I already did to no avail). And... The inside of the box had this little sticker that said (almost with a desperate tone) ""Please don't return this item to the store you bought it at, if you're having trouble please contact our technical support.""

That is where this case comes in to play. We wanted something that would offer a decent amount of protection, without spending a lot of money.

1105821,"I'm already a Mac user and own several.  Also been buying Apple computers since 1986.

Unlike other reviews, I'm not rating the excellent and stable operating system.  I'm just rating the computer itself.

What a great little machine.  No problems whatsoever.  Looks like Apple fixed the issues regarding the staining of plastic.

The power adapter has a built-in cord caddy and it also converts from a power brick into a fully corded adapter by changing the prongs over to an included and optional cord.  Also the connector on the computer is magnetic and break-away which protects you from pulling the computer off a table when tripping over the cord.  There is an green/red indicator light right on the connector.

The computer instantly sleeps when you close the lid and it wakes within 2 seconds of opening the lid.  Battery life is about 4 hours during use and in sleep mode the battery lasts for days.  The lid is latched via a hidden magnet - nothing here to break and the lid closes tightly.  Very nice.

You can also turn off the back-light in the screen if you want to use the computer with an external monitor.  Otherwise you'd have to close the lid and that would put it to sleep.

The screen is high gloss but it hasn't been a problem and it's very bright even when using it outdoors.

The built-in wireless networking is flawless and the bluetooth worked instantly with my cell phone.

All the ports are nicely organized on one side of the machine and the DVD slot on the opposite side.

The caps-lock and the num-lock keys are actually back-lit green.  They glow green from behind when activated.  In a darkened room, this looks very cool along with the light up Apple logo on the front of the lid.

The tiny iSight camera is built in right above the screen and the resolution is incredible when you compare it to average web cams.  There is a microphone on one side of the camera and a little green LED on the other which indicates the camera is live.

Everything is very very nice and it looks very nice too.  Excellent computer for the money.  First class all the way.  Don't forget the $100 rebate...  two seconds to fill it out online - no hassles, no paperwork required- VERY easy!",5.0

Pro's:
Very thin, perfect for stacking more than one on USB ports (HTPC, NAS, Router, etc).
Read/write light.
Large enough for Notebook backup use.

Con's:
No lanyard key-chain string comes with it and no hole or loop to attach one.
Write speed is extremely slow.

Final thoughts:
If write speed is not an issue and you want to stack two on your wifi router or you PC without wasting USB ports with fat sticks that take up two slots, then this is a good low priced solution. If you don't mind paying a premium, I recommend PQI 1st and PNY 2nd.",3.0

I have used it mostly for capturing dog-training classes -- Agility and Herding.  I can hand it off to a fellow class-member, give them 10 seconds of instructions (""Turn it on there, and stop/start the video with the big red button"") and I end up with hours of very useful videos of me & my dogs that I can watch later to review what we did right or wrong, and to listen again to my trainers' comments.

If you don't use the zoom, the picture is fantastic.  I can hook it up directly to a standard 37-inch TV and the video is terrific.  Sound is amazing, considering the basic microphone.

But the zoom is awful.  It's digital, not optical, so that means the picture gets fuzzy, like blowing up a lo-res .jpg picture.  I just don't even use the zoom anymore.

It creates huge .wav files.  E.g. 13 minutes of video = 260 MB.  But you can use Windows Movie Maker (or Adobe Premiere or whatever) to reduce file size without markedly compromising visual quality.

Battery life is so-so.  Always need to have an extra set on hand.

I've connected it to 2 different laptops running XP and to one running Vista, and in all cases, the software installed and runs seamlessly.

I bought it at $149, and now that it's just $100, it's easily worth the money, if you want a camcorder that's cheap & small enough to always have on hand to capture those candid moments.  Definitely not a good substitute for capturing those Big Life Moments like a wedding, but well worth the pennies if you want a cheap, easy-to-use way to snag the many smaller moments in life.",4.0

It is really a fantastic device for the money. Initally was going to get the ss4200 NAS from Intel but this has more functions for a little more money. It may not be as fast as the ss4200 but for my needs was fine.
Additionally I have learned to use WHS which is a great operating system which I have had no problems with to date. Works great with other Microsoft based OS's for backing up computers and automatically setting up network sharing etc...

8403737,"PROS:
+ Fits the Dragon Touch Y88X 7"" tablet perfectly and snugly -- there's also a strap with velcro which attaches to the inside back cover to secure the tablet
+ Bright vibrant green which matches and accents the (green) tablet perfectly
+ Front cover snaps shut with a magnetic closure, which adds a bit of peace of mind while it's clunking around in a purse, bag, or backpack
+ The cover can fold back and hook into a cutout on the back to form a faux-kickstand (see Neutrals)
+ Has a nice texture which doesn't become slippery when moist (i.e. when being held with sweaty hands)
+ Outside is easy to clean (the inside is a faux-suede material, so it's less easy to clean)

NEUTRALS:
* To access the SD card, although the slot is visible, requires you take the tablet out of the case; I listed this under neutrals rather than Cons because I believe this is mostly a problem based on the tablet's design rather than the case (i.e. there's not much the case could do to make the SD card easy access)
* When using the faux-kickstand, the case becomes from heavy and will easily tip over if you aren't careful
* Also, the angle of the faux-kickstand is steep (just shy of straight up and down), which might be uncomfortable for some, and it's not adjustable

CONS:
- Rather than having a full opening for the speaker, there are two holes and, unfortunately, this does adversely effect the sound quality and volume
- It cover the microphone, which only hampers an already iffy microphone

Overall, this is a good Dragon Touch tablet cover that does an excellent job of keeping my tablet scratch-free and tidy. Even after over a month of use, it still looks and feels almost new.

Just received the case (in clear) today. I have a Dell XPS 13.3"" 9360 (not the 2-in-1) and I'm not entirely sure this case was meant for this particular model? It took a little bit of effort to snap in the top part of the case (though the bottom one slipped on easy-peasy) and I'm still not 100% sure it'll provide that much protection, especially to the vulnerable top corners; although they're still covered somewhat, the top corners aren't totally wrapped in the case. There's also a little bit of give/movement at the top lip of the case, even after everything else has been snapped on.

Still, despite my constant putting on and taking off the top case, it didn't scratch my laptop at all and didn't snap off. There is a bit of space when you close your laptop, like other reviewers have said, but it doesn't really bother me that much. The legs at the bottom are a nice addition, and none of the important ports are covered. Overall, I'd say I'm pretty pleased with the product at the price point, and I look forward to being able to put stickers onto my computer w/ impudence lol

And once dialed in, the depth of color and dynamic range is pro level, and I would put this next to most IPS LED monitors and see it lacks nothing essential.

I'm impressed at how it handles blacks too, blowing away my old samsung LED. No light leaks on my model either. From a cold state to warm up, I notice no shift in tone, saturation, or brightness.

Refresh rates for gaming/movies is not what it was designed to be optimal for. And I haven't/don't use it in the vertical portrait orientation so I cannot speak to that function.

1056098,"Echoing what most others have said, this is a great camera. It's a dream to use, and the pictures are stunning.

Since it's based on a Minolta design, it accepts the lenses from my old Minolta Maxxum 9000 (circa mid 1980s).  This is a huge benefit to me; I now have an excellent quality 70-210mm zoom lens for my new Alpha-100 for no additional cost!  The auto-focus and TTL metering work properly, and since the anti-shake hardware is in the camera body, that works with the old lens also.  Even my old Minolta cable release (a switch on the end of an electrical cable with a proprietary rectangular plug) connects and works fine.

I'm very happy with the camera.  That said, there are a couple of annoyances. One of them might be significant to you, depending on how you want to use the camera.

First, noise.  Not picture noise, as in grainy low-light photos, but acoustic noise.  The shutter mechanism is *loud*, much louder than my old Maxxum 9000.  If you want to be an unnoticed photographer taking discreet pictures like Cartier-Bresson with his Leica, this isn't your camera.

Second, the lens shade.  This is a nit, but I find it more clumsy to use than the lens shade on the old camera.  The old one was held on by a spring clasp; you just squeeze on opposite sides to install or remove it, or to reverse it for storage.  The new one has to be positioned precisely so that tabs will lock into place when it is turned.  Not as quick or as easy to use, but not really a big deal.  I suppose it saved a couple of dollars, as the new one is one piece of plastic while the old one had several parts.

On the whole, an excellent product.  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.",5.0

Now that is out of the way, on to my opinion about this very affordable and well equipped receiver. This is my second Onkyo and I have been impressed with both of them. Value for dollar has been exceptional in my opinion. I had to upgrade to this one only because I need hdmi switching.

Totally reliable
Great Sound
Enough power

5669344,"This was the second HDMI cable I've purchased from Blue Rigger.  The 1st was a 15 footer, to run from my PC to my TV.  I've rearranged the living room, so it was necessary to get a much longer cable, hince the 35ft cable purchase.  It works flawlessly, just as the other one did.  I expected this because I was very happy with the other cable.  The build quality is nice, the cable is very soft and flexible and not overly thick, and the connectors aren't the super cheap plastic ones that will separate if handled too often.  I have purchased other HDMI cables previously, thinking that a quality cable must be the size of a garden hose, but I have learned better.  These Blue Rigger cables will not over stress your precious HDMI ports on your TV/Receiver/PC Video card, etc., so they are a must have for anyone who doesn't care to shorten the life of their equipment due to overly stiff, fat, heavy HDMI cables.  Don't be fooled by the hype, you don't need $100 digital cables, and you don't need cables the size of fire hoses which will only over stress your HDMI ports.  I just had the HDMI board on my 3 yr old TV replaced, and I'm wondering now if it's due to the super thick Acoustic Research cables I previously had connected.  Never again.  I will add the old heavy cables to my collection of self defense weaponry, and from here on out I will Buy Blue Rigger; they deliver the goods at a very reasonable price.",5.0

And then it didn't.

It turns out that the Nvidia ti 550 doesn't have quite as accurate as of a clock as it should an that matters for HDMI. Using Display Port mode lessens the issue, but apparently a new cable and a barely used (1 week) makes a difference After a week of use I started losing sync again.

Even battery life is good (about 5 hours at full tilt)!
There are cheaper machines out there, but for the money, there's no reason to settle for something less. The touchscreen is great.

Where it falls down is that it does not work with the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S (2016). The 2x USB ports work, but charging is severely impacted and HDMI does not function.

These stay on me all day in construction totally hands free talk capable - the headset even announces the incoming phone number to you... the music sound quality is TOP NOTCH !!

Very comfortable in the ear style buds.  easy to clean, and did I mention how awesome the sound is while zoning out to music ?! I have had 4 of these because the quality of the wire covering/coating wears off where the wires come out of the main body, if LG would move the wire to exit the main body via the top of the unit this problem goes away.  Three of these the wires wore through and the ear piece stopped working (6 months on one, 8 months on another, and one unit the left ear piece just stopped working after 4 months) ALL were denied for returns because of the time passed...

I use my tablet all the time, but when I have to write anything longer than a few words I get kind of frustrated because its not super easy to type on the touchscreen. The case has a nice leather feel to it and fits snugly on the tablet. The keyboard works as intended and connects via Bluetooth so it should connect to any other device that youd like to use it with. The keyboard is also removable so you can work from farther away if youd like.

The package comes with the case/keyboard, stylus, screen protector, and a charging chord. Its a good deal for a great product if you ask me.

19123592,"Pros:
Near perfect accuracy, Satisfying click, Fully customizable buttons. More comfortable than most mice. Capable of up to 6 DPI settings programmed at once.

Cons:
The left side of my right hand feels unsupported and it strangely causes my pinky to become stiff during gaming sessions. It feels like my last two knuckles are resting on a slope. This mouse seems better for gamers who use their mouse with their hand in a 'claw' shape than those who rest their entire palm on the mouse while they play. Also, the side buttons are clustered together so you have to be very careful about which one you mean to push. Also, this isn't really a 'con' so much as a 'hmm' but they've included a button that toggles the ratchet on the scrollwheel. Don't get me wrong, it's mad fun to flick it in smooth scroll mode and just feel it spin... but I can't think of an actual useful purpose for needing a scroll wheel that goes that fast without a ratchet.

Overall:
I'm loving this mouse, the accuracy itself is enough to overlook the few small problems I've found with it. I wish the side buttons were spaced apart better. I wish it was wider or flatter for my big hands. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this mouse especially if you use your mouse with your hand in a claw style rather than a full-palm style.",4.0

6919635,"I was supremely pleased with this purchase. I'd been looking for a budget gaming laptop in the $500-600 range and found this through a different website (I went with Amazon because they had a better price by about $60). For a gaming system, the bottleneck is usually in graphics, but this computer has a decent-enough graphics card. The trade-off is that it has a smaller, slower hard drive, a dual-core (as opposed to quad) processor and only 4 gigs of RAM (although it can be upgraded to 8). What I ended up with was a system that can play any game I own at a decent resolution, even new titles like Skyrim. I haven't tried resource hogs like the Crysis series, so your mileage may vary.

It's not a completely perfect system. There's some bloatware to be uninstalled (although less than I've had with other manufacturers) and the keyboard layout is a little funky. Ins and Del have been moved to the Function row, and the volume controls are alternate functions of arrow keys--meaning there's no way to change the volume one-handed. The usb ports are all towards the front of the machine, which is not to my preference.

1253409,"Lord, do I hate this keyboard.  What a thorn in my side.  Or rather, my Vista.

Gripes:

1.  Software that comes with it not friendly.  You either install the software or the keyboard doesn't work.  Worse, once you install the software, you can't easily uninstall it.  There's no shortcut for ""Uninstall,"" for example.  It's like it never occurred to Logitech that anybody would ever want to uninstall their software.

2.  The software conflicted with my onboard soundcard!  I found this hard to credit at first, since what does a mouse-and-keyboard combo have to do with your sound?  Nevertheless, this thing monkeyed somehow with the output devices to the point where I couldn't get any sound.  After uninstalling it, the sound came back.  Re-installing it, the sound went away again.  I have since installed a sound card anyhow, but what on earth was Logitech's software doing interfering with this?

3.  Keyboard is incredibly inanely designed.  Not all of the functionality buttons are customizable, that's a problem.  But the real problem is that some of them cannot even be disabled.  In particular, there is a little optical reader next to the left shift key that changes the magnification of the screen when you hit it.  Unfortunately, your left pinky will be inadvertently hitting it all the time, messing with the view settings of whatever you're looking at.  This little reader couldn't be assigned another function (e.g., do nothing) or disabled, so in the end I had to physically cover it up with duct tape to use my computer without harassment.",1.0

Nice (overboard) presentation of product but the product is lacking.  The lightning connector does not click in like the (Apple supplied) OEM

2503884,"The Fuze has more features than I want, but it is very easy to use and it is very easy to ignore the useless features.

When you get the unit, plug it in to the USB cable to charge it. Once it is charged, go into the settings menu and change the mode to MSC. This makes the Fuze act like a regular flash drive, so it will work with any operating system that supports USB. Next, format the unit. Sandisk includes some sample music that was installed in MTP mode. The two modes are not compatible, so your player will have wasted space if you keep the sample music.

Next, go to Sandisk's website. They will have a *.bin file available so you can flash the Fuze's firmware to the latest version. Just copy the file over with any file manager. They do have an updater program, but that doesn't work on my OS.

You now have a player that can handle FLAC and OGG format audio, as well as all the usual ones. That means Librivox and Project Gutenberg audiobooks work, so hard to find classics are easy to get. And if you're an audiophile, you can use FLAC for higher quality sound. There is enough space to fit at least 4 hours of MP3s and a short audiobook.

EDIT: I've picked up a set of cheap IEMs (jvc air cushions, about 80-90% as good as the high end IEMs I've used, at 1/10 the price). The sound is now very clear, with no hiss. Sometimes a good audio chip will have software that adds hiss, but the Fuze is free of this problem. The whole setup will easily fit into a jeans pocket, even if you're a curvy female who likes a close fit.

The display is not visible on a sunny day in direct sun on the lowest brightness setting. Tilting it slightly solves that. The clock is visible even when the unit is locked.

The radio sounded quite clear in my few minutes of playing with it... it's definitely a useless feature for me.

The delete option is a little confusing. I haven't found a way to delete a song unless it is playing. I'm used to doing the odd cleanup on my player to get rid of songs I'm tired of, and I can't find a way to do that without a computer. Very minor annoyance.",5.0

I use it at work (I work in a loud print shop) and I only have to charge it every 3 days.

The only thing that was a negative were the earplugs that came with it. As soon as I took them out and tried to untangle them, they broke. Which, I guess isn't a real huge loss since they probably weren't the best quality earplugs anyways.

20944441,"Ordered for motorcycle helmet.  Curved piece was too curved for the front of my helmet, using the flat piece.

Pros: GoPro OEM mounts and pieces are stronger than knock off plastic.  I've broken enough to know.  Mounts have the rubber anti-vibration/lock grommet that actually works.  Not scared of base flying off at highway speeds due to 3M adhesive foam.  Perfect angle and height on my motorcycle helmet(HJC CL-17).

Cons: Even with the extended height mount I still could not get the angle that I wanted on my helmet. I had to use the extender piece, which I wish was instead a longer single piece.  However, the current 90 degree turn angles on the arms are fine since it includes two and acts like one long piece. I do wish that they would have included flush screws instead of the T screws or the longer screws so would not have to see that much coming off of the mount. I also wish that the foam on GoPro bases that have the adhesive would be thicker, so it would be easier to mount on slightly curved surfaces.  However, that could have been easily negated by doubling up the adhesive foam and pressing harder.  I could not since the adhesive on all the bases came pre-adhered to so of them, and I didn't have any spare.

Final Thoughts:
Not sure if the old j-hook mount would have given me a better angle, because I wanted the camera at that exact place and that angle.  Might take some heat to the base to soften up the adhesive and  take it off in order to re-adhere it with two foam pads for extra security.  Overall, a very useful kit if you plan on mounting to helmets or other odd angles, or even if you only need a little bit of elevation.",4.0

20696457,"I purchased this stand in Sept of last year.  I have arthritis in my fingers and holding my Kindle to read is painful.  I use it primarily for my Kindle Voyage & Oasis but often for my Kindle Fire 10HD.  The stand has really helped my fingers and reading is back to being completed with ease. It's incredibly strong and steady. It NEVER tips over.  Its not lite but I can and do carry it up and down my stairs daily. It also Holds my 10"" Kindle Fire with the cover, solidly and the tablet is not lite.  The stand's appearance is professional and I like the brushed nickel finish. No fingerprints!

I'll mention two things that could be considered ""wear and tear"" and for the second a design flaw as well.  Both are why I have dropped one star.  Its important to remember that I've been using the stand for almost year, carrying it up and down stairs daily, repeatedly on the weekends and twisting and adjusting the angle constantly

The first reason for the drop of a star, is that the Allen or hex key screw at the base, no longer stays tightened.  I typically have to ask my husband to tighten it about once or twice a week.  In my experience this is almost expected of any hex screw.

The second and most damaging is that the piece at the top of the stand, which holds the arm is starting to crack.  Its made from metal and sturdy but the repeated use, adjusting the tilt, etc. has caused the metal to strain and recently crack.

Are my two reasons for dropping a star fair?  Unfair?  I'm not sure, you'll have to decide for yourself.  I like the stand and will continue to use it until the crack finishes its decent.  Will I buy this one again?  Well, I'll look at what's available, read the reviews and see.  I know this one is good for at least a year maybe more we'll see.

I selected this one for two reasons:

1. Cost  2. Hot Key capability

I had no need for the audio connections that were configured into both sets of cables and they make the installation more cluttered.  That being said,  setup and programming are very easy.  The unit comes with a software disc.  All that's on it is software to install the hot key applet.  FYI - the software does have to be installed on both machines to do hot key switching both ways.

The only gotcha is when you shutdown one machine, you need to switch over to the other machine immediately.  Just in case you aren't fast enough, there is a manual switch connected to the KVM itself.

It worked great the first time I tried it and overall I'm very happy with this product.  I gave it 4 stars because of the unavoidable clutter created by the audio cables.  Luckily for me, the switch and all the connectors are out of view in a computer cabinet.

15390000,"First monitor arrived with a few dead sub-pixels. Asked for replacement. The replacement came with many completely dead pixels. It seems like most smaller monitors with high resolutions have this problem. Apparently these companies believe it's acceptable to have a few dead sub-pixels or dead pixels on a brand new monitor that you forked over $400 for or more. As customers, you should not allow this. Complain to the manufacturing companies and complain to Amazon for allowing the selling of defective products. I would spend $100 to ensure my monitor will have no dead pixels at all. My smartphone which has the same resolution which therefore has far smaller pixels than a 24"" screen, has not even one damaged pixel AT ALL. This is unacceptable.

Aside from that, lets judge the monitor itself. First off, the screen looks amazingly clear, far better than other competitors. However, the power button is on the bottom of the screen which is very irritating to push. In addition, this monitor has an energy saving mode which cannot be turned off. Basically it turns the monitor off from inactivity and you're required to push a button to the right of the power button, which is completely unnecessary and annoying.

1)  the shoe of this adapter is slightly too thick to fit snugly in the camera's on board AIS shoe. It can be inserted in my camera's shoe but it will not move forward to snap in place.
2) The knurled wheel used to tighten the MSA-2 is too large and overlaps the camera's AIS shoe cover when it is folded backward.. This prevents the user from tightening the MSA-2, and it and any object attached to it will soon fall off and probably break. This situation would happen even if the MAS-2 was installed in its correct position..

1686333,"I was introduced to these speakers in broadcast work, TV specifically.

What these are, is nearly indestructible, 5 1/4 inch two way, passive, 4 ohm speakers that are excellent at faithfully reproducing audio.

They don't have pretty cabinets, they have fourth order crossovers.

They don't have binding posts, they use spring clips, the clips are quick connect when in the field and I've connected them to 200 wpc commercial amps without fear.

They have a balanced sound, with front porting that make them easy to listen to and alright to mix with, but that's not really the type of monitoring that I use them for. They have solid bass down towards 80 Hz, making them perfect for use with a subwoofer and quality listening/monitoring, rather than mixing, is why I buy them. Instruments, like keyboards or electronic drums or any samples or vocals can also be monitored from these and of course music playback.

The mounts that are included barely work and almost everyone who uses them, complains or upgrades them, I don't care to use mounts anyway, but plan for them to droop. At 4 lbs apiece, these are not lightweight plastic speakers and their dimensions are 9.3 x 6.3 x 5.6 in inches.

JBL Professional is just what it says and these are excellent speakers, capable of mixing with, but mostly used for playback wherever you need more rugged speakers, like travel, outdoors or commercial use. If you want to buy near field studio monitors, look at the LSR line and spend a lot more money, but these are a bargain for what you pay, they are real speakers.

If you are shopping for high quality, extremely natural sounding, front ported, to reduce the boundary effect, extra rugged speakers, these should be near the top of your short list.

Before I go any further, I did replace the large front speakers with a pair that match the rears. This setup suited my needs and look better than the large even though I sacraficed sound for looks. Other reviews are true, buy some good quality speaker wire before you get the unit. After installation, I calibrated the system as stated in the setup manual.

From action movies, comedies, rock music, country music, hip hop, you name it, the system sounds quite well in all aspects.

19444184,"This case does a good job protecting my Kindle Voyage and it was a good price. It is light and easy to hold.

Beyond protection, the main thing I was looking for was a way to set my Kindle upright on the table in front of me. I find myself frequently eating alone in restaurants or at home and I tend to read while I eat. So, the qualities I want most are (1) stability and (2) upright angle. For these reasons, this product gets 4/5 stars. Because the Kindle has to be far enough away so that it's not in my plate, it needs to be a little more upright than this case makes it. Not bad, but not ideal. Also, as some others have complained about, the design of the case is to make it upright. But because the hinge is on the vertical and not in the middle, it had a tendency to lean right. Bumped a little and it has a tendency to topple over. It hasn't actually happened yet, so it is more anxiety over the prospect than actual calamity that I'm whining about. Maybe two years from now I'll say, ""Wow, the problem I thought I had never happened."" We'll see. The other supposed eventuality I'm expecting is that the hinge will get looser over time and not hold up so well. Again, anticipation and not actual experience...yet.

Keep in mind, I recognize my misgivings as that and not actual faults. I hope you count 4 of 5 stars ratings like I do. I make buying decisions based on 4 and 5 star reviews.

17270196,"Nice lens, especially for the money.  The plus for me was native e-mount support.  I've taken some sharp pictures without much trouble.  The 35mm is a mild telephoto on an APS-C sensor.  It's equivalent to the 50mm range in full frame cameras.  Note:  this is a manual lens.  It does not have auto focus or auto exposure.  You have to set up the camera to shoot without a lens, in the bizarre wording of the menus.  As long as you enable focus peaking and MF assist (magnification) focusing is easy.  If you set the mode dial to A(perture) and use a fixed aperture the camera will set the shutter speed.  This is a good learning tool.  You have to frame your shot and focus it yourself.  Because it isn't a zoom you have to think about where you stand to take the picture.

If you're interested in inexpensive manual lenses you should also investigate used film camera lenses.  For Sony mirrorless you'll have to buy an inexpensive adapter.

I guess these headphones required breaking in.  the noise reduction works decently. there is a slight hiss when its on and when theres no audio. but the hiss is virtually gone when the music starts playing.

These are excellent headphones for death metal (or any metal/rock genre). The bass is not overpowering, but is substantial, especially after they are played for a while. The mids are a little lacking in some songs, but others they are great.. I can't attribute it to the headphones, I would most likely guess it was the audio file itself. I use these for my computer, and I also game a lot with them. They are excellent for any game out there and provide great left/right directional audio. However, if you are a big listener of heavy bass (rap, hip hop, r&b, dubstep, etc.), I can't recommend these.. They were lacking on the very low end, it's almost like they couldn't handle repeated, long bass notes. But, like I said, they are excellent for any other type of music, including metal, rock, country, etc.. just not so much with prolonged, extremely deep bass notes.

The build quality is excellent for the price range, they are very comfortable to wear, and they block out noise from inside and out as well as any other headphone that aren't noise-cancelling (the closed back design helps with this I think?). The cord is more than sufficient in length, but I'm not sure if the spring actually will help with and cord/plug separation.. only time will tell in that regard. Overall, excellent headphones for the price, definitely 5 stars.. some people need to realize these aren't Audeze LCD3's.",5.0

That really holds true for this handy organizer clutch by Belfen.

It is 'Saffiano' leather.
What does that mean? Is it a fake leather?
No. It is leather that has been embossed in such a way as to make it more durable and easy care. Saffiano can be any grade of leather and it won't scratch like kid leather. It also wipes clean.

So this clutch is sturdy and stain resistant. Lots of compartments and a nice fob zips it closed. The color is between a navy and a nautical blue.
Even if you don't use it as a phone case, it is quite nice as a regular wallet or organizer.

3039303,"There are a lot of nice features in this case:
-Easy to remove side panels (no screws!)
-Smart airflow design
-Useful installation guide
-Works great with liquid cooling
-Case has thick walls and solid connectors/brackets--feels high quality

Minor Issues:
-Challenging to assemble. I had to go back and rearrange cables/pull out components to get things to fit (I expected this issue tho)
-There are smaller cases for mini-itx
-This case did not fit the Corsair H80i water cooler (the radiator was too fat) but the H55 fit without issue
-Essentially required to use Silverstone SFX PSU @ 450W

Other Thoughts: This is my second itx build and it came together beautifully. The cable management and cooling was excellent with this case. The brackets holding the slim dvd/hdd/ssd have space that is perfect for containing extra cabling or threading cables through to the other side of the case. The only issue I ran into was the water cooler being too large (DVD bracket did not fit on top of the cooler).

I like to maximize internal airflow and do not require much storage so I opted for a single SSD, which allowed me to remove a large hdd bracket.

Specs for my build:
GIGABYTE GA-Z87N-WIFI
Intel 4770k
EVGA GTX 760
Corsair Vengeance 16GB
Corsair H55 liquid cooler
Silverstone ST45SF 450w PSU
Samsung 840 EVO 250GB SSD
SIlverstone slim Blu-Ray writer

The GPU states a min PSU requirement of 500W but gaming has been fine so far with the 450W.

I applied a small amount of Arctic Silver, rubbed it in, wiped off with a coffee filter, and applied the H55 with stock grease. Running Prime95 for about 45 min had temps around 67C, with one anomalous spike to 74C. Moderate browsing has temp avg in the low 30's.

15084917,"Prior to getting this camera, I really wanted the Canon 70d with the 18-135mm lens because it had all these awesome new features such as great autofocus and the lens could zoom pretty far BUT I didn't really have the budget for it.  IT's quite expensive.  So i kept on researching cameras to see if there was anything similar to the 70d for a cheaper price and the Canon t5i video Creator kit kept on popping up.  For half the price of the 70d, I was able to get an awesome Canon t5i package deal and couldn't have been happier!!  Now that I have the t5i I know that it was the camera for me because the 70d is labeled as ""semi-professional"" and I had never really used a DSLR before, also I like the smallness of the canon t5i, the canon 70d would've been too bulky for me.  I'm also happy with the 18-55 mm lens because it is small and easy to carry around and has a decent zoom on it.  I am thinking of purchasing the 50 mm lens and the 55-250 lens for versatility purposes later on but the 18-55mm lens is an awesome starter lens.
I wanted to use a DSLR mainly for filming.  I can't believe the video quality of the canon t5i!  The colors stand out so nicely!!  Soon after the package came in, I had the opportunity to film a wedding with it and it was beautiful!!  I used the 18-55mm lens and it looked like someone professional and filmed the wedding!!!
For anyone who is on a low budget and would want a professional looking camera for picture and video, this is the one to get!!",5.0

It seems an easy enough task to replace an ear pad really, (and if it wasn't such a problem, this product should rate a 5 star), but despite being careful with use and despite delicately handling the thin foam during replacements, it not only falls off easily, it also tears easily.  It's hard to describe what makes it extra difficult, but there are two plastic pieces about 2 mm apart that you have to get this delicate foam to fit into.  Let's just say it sort of feels like trying to put a full sheet on a queen bed ;) We glued the tear and replaced the pad, but the darn thing just will not stay on and continues to rip in the process.  Now you could 1. remove the pads and just use the solid hard plastic underneath (not the most comfortable but definitely an option), or 2. glue the pads to the earpiece.

It wasn't my first choice, I'd actually decided on their house brand TV [made by LG] but everytime I got one home it had issues (either busted screen or missing parts, etc). So the AV manager at this store ""upgraded"" me to this Sharp at a substantially reduced cost. For around 400 dollars I thought it was a pretty good value on a brand name I recognized. I wasn't able to see a display model function before bringing it home nor could I review what connectors it had, so this is with a grain of salt as they say...

Unfortunately though, I have been less than impressed with it. I found the picture to be not very clear, movies display a little dark, and the pre-canned calibration options are horrible. No reviews of this model on CNET, and no user forums with any insight on calibration settings so I'm in uncharted waters here. The speakers are completely inadequate, par for the course with these slim TVs these days so no surprise there...but(!), this TV also lacks one output that is considered standard on most larger flat TVs; the Optical Audio output. It does have a RCA jack labelled ""Digital Audio Output"" which after researching is still an S/PDIF format (same as Optical), but utilizes the Sony/Phillips form factor connection instead of the standardized Toslink (Optical Audio) connector. Way to go Sharp! Why Sharp is using the Sony/Phillips connector in their brand TV is beyond rediculous to me. My Sony home theater receiver, PS3, and Panasonic DVD & VHS players all have Toslink Optical audio jacks on them...but not the Sharp TV. So at this point I'm looking at having to buy a $25 RCA to Toslink adapter, or a new home theater receiver, or return this TV despite the great deal I received.

The design is sweet to look at, but completely unobtrusive when compared to blocky Windows speakers. The installation is as easy as they come (plug it in - sheesh, my mom could do this).
The sound was great out of the box, but the real trick for XP users is to maximize their sound output through a combo of the Windows Audio settings in the Control Panel, and through your MP3 software (I find WinAmp3 works best.) Once you've got the finer settings down, the fidelity is UNREAL.

15344135,"I wanted to love this -- but I have to share some serious drawbacks.

For me, one of the main minuses of more expensive record cleaning machines is the time they need take to clean each record.  I want a nice deep clean -- but I am just not going to spend the amount of time it would take to listen to each of my records to clean them. Spin clean seemed perfect -- especially with glowing reviews.  However, allowing for dry time after turning the record in a water bath is also time consuming and the amount of water on your records seems a hazard to labels and sleeves -- unless you are slow and fussy.

When lifted out of the washer -- the records are very wet -- with a think coating of water and drops.  After a number of washes, I found the pads did not snugly and evenly always coat a record.  AND even if they did, the pads often do not reach the grooves closest to the label.  The result is that you have sopping wet records near the edges and completely untouched tracks near the center.  You can use the included cloths to dry the record and clean the centermost grooves, but you need serious air dry time before putting them back in the sleeves.  A LOT of flat space is needed for drying if you are cleaning more than one record.  Also, just to be honest, I found the water tank showed evidence of dust from my records but not a dramatic amount of dirt.

The pluses are that the records do seem very shiny (think new car tires) -- and the lint-free wiping clothes are wonderful -- very soft and absorbent.  I ended up putting a couple of capfuls of the solution in a spray bottle with water, shaking gently, and then spirtzing the cloths and giving my records a firm counterclockwise wipe on each side.  They are instantly recady to put back in the sleeves -- and seem to still get a nice shine.  Previously, I had used a solution of water and rubbing alcohol -- which did not impart such shine.",2.0

17980194,"Buyers Beware!

I bought this exact model in June of 2008 and for a short time everything ran beautifully.
After about 6 months I noticed my tablet started running hot and my wireless card was acting up.
I had been instructed by HP to update to the latest BIOS (More on that later), and reset my power
settings to HP ""Balanced"". For a short time these fixes seemed to work. At 1 year, just before my
warranty expired my wireless card went out and HP took my computer in for repair and replaced the
Mother Board! Now 7 months later I decided to get some temps on my GPU and CPU and at several points
my GPU temp is as high as 214c!

Now on to the BIOS. HP has known that these computers have a defective NVidia 6150Go Chip Set and run hot,
so rather than recalling, refunding, or replacing them they updated the BIOS so the FAN within the tablet
would stay on ALL THE TIME, prolonging the life of the Mother Board and thus getting people out of their
Warranty Periods. Neither Nvidia or HP have come clean about which ""Chip Sets"" were affected by the bad soldering
but NVidia has been sued by it's share holders because of the defective products and Apple and Sony both ran
their own investigations and did right by their customers! HP on the other has not. There are entire websites and
forums dedicated to HP customers trying to get their money back because of the scam HP is running (selling defective product then charging for repairs), and many people have started to take HP to small claims court and are winning.

As a side note I am currently dealing with HP regarding my TX2120US issues and I am pursuing a full refund because I will NEVER by HP again!

1613884,"I bought this drive for the purpose of having a small public drive partition for swap space, a large partition that could only be accessed by entering a password (in case I were to misplace the drive), and the write-protect switch feature.

What you get in the package is the drive and a very nice lanyard.  The drive contains the IMATION drive manager software, which provides what appears to be a convenient interface that allows you to configure the size of a ""public"" partition that can be accessed just by plugging in the drive, and a ""secure"" partition that is configured to be the remainder of the drive capacity.  You switch between the public partition and the secure partition by running their ""lock.exe"" program which requires you to put in a password for access.

As purely a USB flash drive, no problems whatsoever.  However, if you expect to use the secure partition(I use the term loosely, as there is no actual encryption to my knowledge), be prepared for a nightmare for the following reasons:

1) When running the lock.exe to switch to the secure partition, one would expect that it would simply map another drive letter so you could still access the public partition at the same time.  This is not the case; you can only access one or the other because they're both mapped to the same drive letter.

2) Which switching from the public partition to the secure one, suppose you run the lock.exe file from windows explorer.  When you make the switch, it automatically closes out windows explorer application, and you must re-open it to browse to the files of interest.  If you anticipate the need to frequently work in the secure partition (I do), this is a ROYAL PITA.

So far this thing hasn't worked more than twenty minutes without stopping! So I contacted the seller, only to be told that to get this thing fixed on HIS dime, I should have purchased an extended warrenty! Really? After such a breathless description from the seller about how terrific this thing was? NOTHING in the description of the item said ""Great item, but will only work for a week or two."" If it had, I certainly wouldn't have wasted my $175. The upshot is, I won't buy from this guy again, EVER, and I probably won't buy from any other Amazon sellers who advertise refurbished items, and I'd REALLY like to know who is writing all these glowing reviews of these people!!!

133617,"If you are looking for value on some L series glass and you don't mind zooming with your feet, this is a great addition to your tool kit.

Pros:Very sharp lens. Affordable for an L at this speed (Under $800 new last check) . Great candid street lens. Discreet with black body. Light weight. Lovely bokeh. USM for fast auto focus. Manual focus ring works wonderfully smooth.

Cons: Not weather sealed. No IS.

I rented this from lensrentals.com before buying and read many reviews before renting. I shoot primes mostly ( 50mm f/1.8, 85mm f/1.8, and 100mm f/1.8 macro so I was very comfortable going into this purchase. Sure, the 2600 dollar 70-200mm f/2.8 would have been a better match to the 24-70mm f/2.8 I already have but I shoot mostly at high shutter speeds or tripod and the cost savings allowed me to invest more in other accessories like lighting and other support gear. No regrets.

I use this with both full frame and crop sensor bodies and the results are always consistent with what I expect.
My suggestion would be to research reviews from as many other pros as possible and try it out first before you buy.
This is a kind of specialty lens that works with my style but may not work with yours.
I hope this review is helpful to you but even the greatest lenses money can buy are no replacement for solid technique and using the right tools for the job.

2505321,"This player had been highly recommended by my brother-in-law, who recently got one, so I purchased it as a a gift for my father. Unfortunately, the software that comes with the product won't install and it makes the Fuze practically impossible for a non-computer expert to use.

Rhapsody is the digital music service provided with the Fuze and a large insert in the packaging says ""[Rhapsody] is the only way to activate all of the features on your new SanDisk Sansa Fuze."" Therefore, I inserted the install disc and was immediately greeted with an error that I had to be online to activate the service.

The parents don't subscribe to broadband because of its cost and they have better things to do than surf the web. So, I logged-on to their 56K service and waited 15 minutes while Rhapsody installed ""Digital Rights Managment File Updates."" At the end of that time, the install failed. When I clicked on Help, the browser brought me to a Rhapsody customer service site that would not let me on without creating an account. I couldn't create an account because their setup failed. It was a catch-22.

I started over.

This time, when a message asked if I would like to install an updated version of the software, I said YES and waited nearly 2 hours for the update to download.

Finally, I manually copied some songs I had ripped in Windows Media Player and listened to them on the Fuze. They sounded great! However, this option is not acceptable for my parents. They need an easy to use service and Rhapsody is obviously not it.

769827,"I ordered a pair of Audio Technica ATH-AD900 headphones based largely on Stereophile magazine's Class A recommendation.  Comfort is very good: They feel very light on the head.  I felt some pressure on my jaw when I first put them on, but this became less noticeable the longer I wore them.  The sound quality was largely as expected: very smoothly and evenly balanced across the entire frequency range (without the woody bass-heaviness of many comparable Sennheiser models or the excessive brightness of Grados), and very detailed.  I did notice a slight coloration on some material, of a type that is difficult to describe with language: A gustatory metaphor like ""sour"" come to mind but makes it sound much worse than it is - it's very subtle, and not very objectionable.  I notice in the frequency response graphs published on various websites that in the lower-to-middle treble area where the measuring techniques produce a series of peaks and valleys in the curve, these headphones peak where most others have valleys, and vice versa - I wonder if that may be the source of the coloration.

The major reason for my low rating, though, is that every time I stood up from a chair while still listening through the 'phones, they delivered a rapid series of electric shocks, coupled with crackling sounds, primarily to my right ear.  Apparently, a static charge must build up in the earpiece farthest from the cord, and since perforated metal shields, covered only by thin cloth, lie very close to the ears inside the cups, the charge sparks easily to the ear.  I don't live in a particularly dry area, I've never had this problem with any other headphones, and changing signal sources, footwear, furniture, etc. did nothing to eliminate the problem.  I returned the 'phones and was sent a replacement (?), which did exactly the same thing, so those too were returned, this time for a refund.  Since this model is being discontinued, I wonder if the discount seller I ordered from might have had seconds stock.

I bought this TV for my bedroom, about 6 ft away from my viewing distance. I watch mainly HD live broadcast, late night HD movies, and Bluray movies and games with PS3 console player over the weekend. Absolutely perfect!
Picture is too sharp and bright on all the presets that you have to tinker with the contrast, brightness and backlighting to suit your taste. CNET reviewed the 52LNA650 and recommended some settings for movie mode via HDMI in a dark room(see CNET website)but this is a smaller version of that TV, and it will be much sharper and brighter, less grainy than its 52 inch sibling. So tune it according to your taste.
For games, you can just leave it on Dynamic Mode and it's fine. For live broadcast and Sports, here are the settings I find pleasing:
Mode: Standard,Contrast-95, Brightness-45, Backlighting-6, Sharpness-50, Color-55:
Detailed settings: Black Adjust: Off,Dynamic contrast: Off, Gamma: 0, Color Space: Native,Flesh tone: 0, Edge enhancement: On
White Balance submenu: Leave it alone!
Picture option submenu: Color tone: normal, size: 16:9, Digital NR: Off,
DNIe: grayed out, HDMI: grayed out, film mode: grayed out,Blue mode: Off, Auto motion plus: Medium.
I switched from Blockbuster to Netflix for streaming movies to this TV, via my Macbook( I will try Roku soon) and it's good enough quality, like a good old VHS tape, mainly because of broadband speed, 2-3mps average in my neighborhood. By the time broadband speed is NOT LIMITED by this greedy providers, it will be much better then. I saw downloads from Apple TV on HD and it's amazing. Soon, streaming HD videos and movies will not be far behind.
Back to the Samsung 40LNA650, the picture quality is as good or even better than the Sony 40XBR6. It should be, since Sony gets their LCD panels from Samsung for ther XBR6 and up. Did I mention video processing is excellent? Whether 1080p Bluray, 1080i or 720p HD channels ,this TV set can display brilliant colors and shades. Even SD channnels are good.

14983271,"The Bose SoundSport are the most comfortable earbuds I have worn yet. As an overall package, the Bose headphones deliver.

The standout feature of the SoundSport is the in ear comfort. The silicone inserts distribute the weight and friction over a larger part of your ear and do not rely solely on insertion into the ear canal to hold the earbuds in place. I found it easy to wear these for 3-4 hours a time.

The construction of the Bose is largely plastic. After a month of use, they have held up well. The overall design seems focused on minimizing weight which makes them light and comfortable to wear. This choice also means they lack robustness. I would not want to keep these in my pocket the way I do cheaper buds. As shown in other reviews, the 3.5mm headjack appears prone to breaking. I would use the supplied carrying pouch at all times.

Performance wise, I had no issues using these buds w/ my Nexus 5. The inline controls and mic worked flawlessly. The sound is clear and detailed with a focus on treble and mid range and a de-emphasis on base. The lack of bass may bother some users since many products on the market focus heavily on base reproduction.

It is well designed, I like the size of the ball, but the button placement leaves a lot to be desired, especially the main button (""left"").  There are two things Logitech must improve.  First, this thing is a battery drain, which is expensive and environmentally unsound.  Second, it's interface to the computer (Mac OS X) is strange.  Many times the behavior is as if the left button is continuously pressed, it would attempt to drag objects I have no interest in dragging and so on.

I also own a roku hd which has the standalone hbo go but constantly locks up and has choppy streaming. The only thing better about the roku is that it has more apps/ channels.

1301741,"In terms of functionality, this case has everything I need: lots of built-in fans and I can even mount an extra fan if I need to. Built-in 3.5'' drive bays are completely removable, and you can remove it with tool-less screws. (However, securing the drives on the drive bays may still require you to have a screw driver.) The top-mounted fan is huge and provides cool air from the chassis even under heavy load (Blend in Prime95). The built-in fans and airflow can keep my motherboard staying below 45 degrees C. As a reference, here's the hardware I put in the system:
Intel i7 4790
32GB (4x8GB) Kingston HyperX 1600Mhz RAM
2 x 2TB WD Green (RAID1)
EVGA Geforce 980 SuperClocked with ACX 2.0 cooling
ASUS Z97-A motherboard
Sound Blaster Xi-Fi Titanium Dedicated Sound Card

Now here comes the bad parts:
1. My case was damaged during shipment. Normally I would just RMA but I don't think this is the fault of either Amazon or the shipper and it's really too much trouble for me as I have to uninstall everything. I think the fault is in the case itself. The hinge on the top cover fell off, and the entire top cover became completely loose as a result. The reason I think it's the case's fault is that the top cover is made completely with plastic, and the most fragile part, which is the hinge, is the made of extremely thin piece of plastic that's almost begging to fall off. If you are in this situation, some simple workarounds can just get it snapped back together.
I'm disappointed as I was expecting the case to be of higher quality at $100.

2. The mounting of 3.5'' drives is confusing and there's almost no instruction that came with it. You need to use the screw bag and pay attention to the following procedure carefully:
1. Take out the tool-less screws after opening the case. (8 for each bay, 4 on each side).
2. Insert the drive in the drive bay.
3. (!) Now you must screw it back in BEFORE you put the bay to the chassis. Otherwise the holes will become obstructed.
4. Put the drive back in.

3. The back panel section is incompatible with my Z97 motherboard's I/O shield. But... Who cares -- I get better cooling w/o it anyways lol.",3.0

I took my dremel out and ground down the standoffs and the screws now hold.  However, now the SD card doesn't go in or out properly.

I like the feel of the book like case and it does keep a Kindle safe with the sturdy plastic. It's also a nice looking case but the lack of a closing element removes a star for me. It's fine for just sitting around protecting the Kindle from dust.

I like the protection and the design of this Kindle case. It's a tad over priced for it's functionality, but for protection this plastic case is good and will keep the Kindle from being knocked about-though the cover may flop open if challenged. It's a little over priced for being an average hard case for Kindle. The design is average but it is sturdy. I like my Kindle to be very snug and protected and for this case to be unable to close even with a simple metallic element makes this not my first go to case for travel with my Kindle.

Mini-DVI to HDMI Cable:

In the world of cables, quite honestly you can get a good deal and still expect a high quality product. This cable is very high quality. It is built very solidly, it's thick, the connections on each end are sturdy and do not wiggle or bend at all.

I have mine connected from my mini-divi port on my white plastic macbook, and on the other end I've connected an HDMI cable to an external 24 inch ASUS monitor. The monitor's HDMI cable (male) plugs into the end of this cable (HDMI female).

HDMI Cable:

This is basically an unlabeled HDMI cable from a major manufacturer (you'll know which one when you receive it). Which means the included HDMI cable would retail separately for about $50. With that said, you can expect extremely high build quality in the HDMI cable. Mine was thick and braided with nylon mesh. Very nice.

Clear picture, no lines or noise at all. Admittedly I am not sitting near any appliances containing electric motors, but I don't expect that would create a problem.

Punchy lows also are helpful when running, to mark the rythm. Noise isolation is very good as well.

18423505,"Absolute trash.  Provides NO TTL information whatsoever between my D3200 and my Yongnuo YN468II.  No exposure information, no zoom information- NOTHING.  Even in pass through mode (with the cord mounted in the hotshoe, and the flash directly above it on them same end of the cord) no information is passed.
The ONLY thing this cord can do is cause the flash to fire like a dumb flash- in other words, at whatever power you manually set your flash to provide.  It is in no way TTL.
Do yourself a favor- give this piece of crap a pass, and grab a pair of YN622N3 Yongnuo transceivers instead.  You will get the TTL functionality this cord promises (but fails to deliver), and far more versatility in terms of flash placement.  The Phottix short, coiled cord is EXTREMELY limiting. The YN622Ns, on the other hand, have an operating range of about 100 meters, which I cannot imagine using.
The 622Ns will also let you add additional flashes as your needs expand and your technique improves (which will happen).
Or, if you're flush and have more exacting needs, do what I did and buy the RN622NTX controller and a YN622N3 triggers.  You can find them as a package deal from Eachshot. They ship from China, but don't worry about that- mine showed up in less than a week.
I literally opened the box, tossed the directions aside, inserted the batteries, mounted the transmitter to the camera and the receiver below my flash, and began shooting properly exposed shots.  This combo provides far more complexity than the average non-pro will ever need, so I will eventually read the manuals and study YouTube tutorials.  But I like the fact that I didn't need to do either to begin using those transceivers.
One final note- get the YN622N version if you have a Nikon, YN622C if you shoot Canon.  They are not interchangeable.",1.0

- Battery only lasts 5 hours, and recharging has to be done on a USB drive (would have to buy an A/C charger for her, since she doesn't have a computer)
- Transition effect from one picture to the next is VERY slow, and there is no option to eliminate it. This is painful when you're trying to find some specific picture.
- Only fits 47 pictures (32MB), since it converts all JPG and GIF to BMP

Installation was a breeze and the transfer speeds have been given an astronomical boost. Transferring 4GB of data would have taken close to 2 hours with original USB 1.0 but only takes 7 minutes with USB 2.0. Needless to say, the  $12.95 + shipping I spent was absolutely worth it.

I was stunned, I was hearing subtle nuances that I had never heard before on my home stereo or car stereo, including other headphones. The bass, mid and treble reproduction is stunning, and the clarity is unbelievable. These headphones are very comfortable, they just about completely block out all external noise and the out of the box quality that I have come to expect from Sony is there.",5.0

14921724,"This TV's WiFi connection ability is very weak. 90% of the time it cannot find the network and connect. Unplugging it, resetting it to original settings, resetting the WiFi modem, updating its software, trouble shooting online, spending hours exploring every option just to make it connect and act like a normal TV...but nothing works.

This is probably the worst piece of electronics I have ever owned. It won't turn on most of the time and if it does turn on, often it won't shut off. This is garbage. Stay away from this brand. Clearly this corporation has major quality control issues. With this TV, it gets worse by the day. I have never seen a piece of electronic equipment degenerate quite like this after only a month. And I have never seen something this expensive have so many problems across the board. I'm not rich and this was a significant and exciting purchase. It was very disappointing to say the least to see this thing slowly fizzle out before my eyes. It really makes you wonder about the LG brand. Never again.

Getting back to the WiFi issue...other devices such as multiple laptops and iPhones in the room have no problem connecting to the WiFi. Turning off all other devices does not enable this TV to connect despite other LG users online advice to do so in one forum. It cannot find a single one of the four quality WiFi networks in this house. It just spins endlessly. You literally have to turn this TV on and off multiple times including unplugging it before you get lucky and it works without freezing and actually connects to the WiFi. This happens very rare though. Clearly LG is no Apple in making things work. This is not an internet capable smart TV since it can't even find and connect to the WiFi internet. What's the point? No wonder it was such a good price...it does not work! Buy a more reliable brand such as a Sony or Samsung.

Amazon was able to help me return this low-quality TV and replace it with better brand.

Despite reading about all the problems in the avsforum.com ""x54 problems and solutions"" thread for this product, I have not had any of the serious problems listed there, although I do forsee some.  This receiver loses the HDMI handshake VERY quickly, so I can see why sound would often cut out.  For instance, the PS3 menu clicks do not work.  And when a game starts on the PS3, it takes a few seconds of the intro before sound starts coming through.  I have not played any games with silent parts in them yet, but I'm told that this receiver will cut off the sound and not return it (metal gear solid 4 is an example).

Just yesterday, after about 3 weeks of use, my AVR254 started making a loud hum/pop sound on startup.  It does not go through the speakers - it just kinda sounds like that electrical sound that would happen when you turned on a really old tube TV.  I'm gonna call HK asap to find out what's wrong.

BS-GS2008 does not follow 802.1W-2001 (or updated 2004 IEEE spec) defining RSTP operation. RSTP acknowledgement is broken.

What happens if this switch is used with other RSTP switches in your network:

 - Bad case: switches block link and never reach forwarding stage (because BS-GS2008 RSTP is broken)

CONS: Either it's not readily apparent through instructions online or in the manual, but I was unable to change the equalizer settings either manually or using Spotify.
